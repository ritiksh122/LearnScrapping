Five-day strike by Greene King workers ends,0:45 10 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/8D63/production/_127959163_untitled-1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-63916476,"A five-day strike by 188 staff working for brewery giant Greene King has ended without a resolution to a pay dispute and with more action planned.Walk-outs took place at sites in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk; Eastwood, Notts; and Abingdon, Oxon.Unite said union members had rejected an offer of a 3% pay rise and one-off payment of £650, and more strikes were planned for 21-23 December.Greene King said it was ""disappointed"" its offer had been rejected.Unite said the pay offer was a substantial real-term wage cut, because of inflation.Unite regional officer Mark Jaina said strike action was not something the union wanted.""Nobody wants to willingly go out on strike and stand in the freezing cold for five days, eight hours a day, but that's the situation we've been put in,"" he said.Mr Jaina said workers were ""sympathetic to the people that like their favourite tipple, but their wages are of paramount importance"".A Greene King spokesperson said: ""We can assure customers that this week's industrial action has not caused significant disruption and pubs across the country continue receiving deliveries from us.""We have received notice for further industrial action from the afternoon of Wednesday, 21 December until the end of Friday, 23 December, but the large majority of our Christmas deliveries will already be completed by this point and we will ensure any disruption to customers is kept to an absolute minimum.""We remain disappointed that the union encouraged its members to reject our offer and we've met regularly with members of Unite over the past few months and explained how we aim to be fair and consistent across our business, given the challenging wider economic environment currently.""Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Bank rules in biggest shake-up in over 30 years,21:19 9 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/12F23/production/_127930677_gettyimages-1245296692.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63905505,"The government has announced what it describes as one of the biggest overhauls of financial regulation for more than three decades.It says the package of more than 30 reforms will ""cut red tape"" and ""turbocharge growth"".Rules that forced banks to legally separate retail banking from riskier investment operations will be reviewed.Those were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis when some banks faced collapse.The package of changes, the ""Edinburgh Reforms"", is being presented as an example of post-Brexit freedom to tailor regulation specifically to the needs and strengths of the UK economy.However, critics say it risks forgetting the lessons of the financial crisis.Between 2007 and 2009 the then-Labour government spent £137bn of public money to bail out banks.Overall, taxpayers have lost £36.4bn on those bailouts, according to the latest estimate from independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility.The plans to ease regulations on financial services are being described as another ""Big Bang"" - a reference to the deregulation of financial services by Margaret Thatcher's government in 1986.The government has already announced it will scrap a cap on bankers' bonuses and allow insurance companies to invest in long-term assets such as housing and windfarms to boost investment and help its levelling up agenda.Rules governing how senior finance executives are hired, monitored and sanctioned will be overhauled.There will also be new rules around bundling investments together into tradeable units - a process called securitisation.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the changes would secure ""the UK's status as one of the most open, dynamic and competitive financial services hubs in the world"".The reforms ""seize on our Brexit freedoms to deliver an agile and home-grown regulatory regime that works in the interest of British people and our businesses"".Mr Hunt met bosses of the UK's largest financial services in Edinburgh on Friday to discuss the reforms.While in Edinburgh he was asked whether the reforms risked sowing the seeds of the next financial crash.He said: ""We have learned the lessons of that crash, we put in place some very important guardrails which will remain, but the banks have become much healthier financially since 2008.""However, Labour's shadow City minister Tulip Siddiq said the reforms would bring more risk.""That this comes after the Tories crashed our economy is beyond misguided,"" adding that the reforms were part of a ""race to the bottom"".Green charity the Finance Innovation Lab said the government ""is taking major risks with the stability of the economy"".""Weakening the essential protections that were put in place after the global financial crisis is an incredibly dangerous move - they help keep the system stable and our money safe,"" said its chief executive Jesse Griffiths.But Chris Hayward, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, said the reforms would not weaken standards.""It's a chance to actually grow our economy and I think we should be very excited about it,"" he said.After the financial crisis of 2008, when the government had to spend billions supporting the UK banking system, a new regime was brought in to increase the personal accountability of senior risk-taking staff.It allowed for fines, bans and even custodial sentences, although there have been very few examples of enforcement.But City insiders say a major disadvantage it imposes is the lengthy process of getting the movement of senior staff to the UK approved by the regulator - making London less attractive to foreign firms.After the financial crisis, large banks were forced to separate or ""ring fence"" their domestic banking operations - mortgages and loans for example - from their investment banking operations, which expose their own cash to market volatility and were deemed riskier.The cost of having two separate shock-absorbing cushions of spare money was seen by some as placing extra costs on the sector.Most of the big banks have spent billions on this ring fencing and are not calling for its reversal.The reforms of ring fencing are aimed at mid-size banks such as Virgin Money and TSB.The government also re-announced more freedom for the pensions and insurance industry to invest in longer term, illiquid assets - those that are hard to sell quickly such as social housing, windfarms, and nuclear - which the government will say helps their levelling up ambitions.It is worth noting that although this will be billed as a Brexit freedom, the EU is undertaking similar reforms.There was a nod to developing the UK as a centre for crypto assets, but with some caveats given the recent bloodbath after the demise of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.Most financial industry leaders say they are crypto curious but do not feel the need to be first on this. ""Let the shipwrecks of others be your seamarks,"" said one.London's position as the pre-eminent European financial centre has been dented in recent years.The UK's capital city briefly lost its long-time crown of most valuable European stock market to Paris before gains in the pound pushed it narrowly back ahead, while Amsterdam took the title of busiest European share dealing centre.Leading hedge fund manager Sir Paul Marshall of Marshall Wace recently described the London financial markets as a ""Jurassic Park"" of old-fashioned companies and investors, and it has struggled to attract the world's fastest growing companies to list on UK exchanges, often losing out to New York, Shanghai or even Amsterdam."
Royal Mail workers begin wave of Christmas strikes,21:04 9 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/084C/production/_127942120_royalmailstrike_gettyimages-1245474443.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63903488,"Thousands of postal workers at Royal Mail are on strike over pay and conditions, potentially causing disruption to customers' festive deliveries.More than 115,000 staff walked out on Friday, with more strikes to follow in the run-up to Christmas.Recent talks between the CWU union and Royal Mail have broken down.Members of the union are expected to continue striking on Sunday as well as on 14, 15, 23 and 24 December.Although there are no letter deliveries on Sundays, there are parcel deliveries, and Royal Mail also processes mail on a Sunday for delivery on a Monday.Last week, Royal Mail advised people to post Christmas mail earlier than usual due to the strikes.Millions of letters have reportedly been piling up as negotiations have stalled, while it has brought forward the final suggested date for sending second class post to 12 December from 19 December, and for first class to 16 December from 21 December.The union has said staff want a pay rise that matches the soaring cost of living and has accused management of trying to ""force through thousands of compulsory redundancies"".Workers carrying placards demanding the removal of Royal Mail's chief executive Simon Thompson gathered outside the Mount Pleasant Mail Centre in London - the company's largest sorting site in the UK.One employee Nick, who has worked for Royal Mail for 38 years, told the BBC that although he had walked out during previous strikes, the distance between management and unions appeared to him to be wider in this wave of industrial action.""It seems to me there's not really a negotiation. It is a take it or leave it deal where they are attacking our terms and conditions.""Inside the sorting office, parcels and letters continued to be sorted by a skeleton crew of 100 people, compared to the 1,000 employees who normally work at the centre.Joy, who has been with Royal Mail for 28 years, told the BBC he had chosen to come to work on a strike day because ""I want to please my customers because of the peak time"".He said that firms are worried about business after the height of the pandemic. ""They need their letters and their mail ASAP,"" he said.""I want to keep moving the mail.""Members of the CWU also staged a rally on Friday afternoon outside Parliament in central London.The union's general secretary, Dave Ward, said at the rally that the union was preparing a fresh ballot over further strike action in January.But speaking during a visit to an RAF base in Lincolnshire, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that he was not ruling out extending ""tough"" new anti-strike laws to prevent walkouts by emergency service workers.He said the government was ""looking at all options"" when he was asked about the potential changes to the law to limit the impact of strikes.The most recent dispute in the postal industry began this summer after Royal Mail rejected demands for a pay rise that matched inflation - the rate at which prices rise - which is currently 11.1%.Royal Mail has been struggling as it moves from its traditional business of delivering letters, which is no longer profitable, to parcel deliveries.It wants to cut 10,000 jobs by next August, which will include 6,000 redundancies and thousands of other roles that will not be filled as staff leave.It also argues that it needs to modernise how the business works to accommodate a rise in parcel deliveries, which would mean changing workers' hours.Dave Ward, the CWU general secretary, said: ""Royal Mail bosses are risking a Christmas meltdown because of their stubborn refusal to treat their employees with respect.""Postal workers want to get on with serving the communities they belong to, delivering Christmas gifts and tackling the backlog from recent weeks.""But they know their value, and they will not meekly accept the casualisation of their jobs, the destruction of their conditions and the impoverishment of their families.""Talks have broken down between the union and Royal Mail, a spokesman said, adding that Royal Mail managers are ""refusing to budge with their 'best and final' offer"".That offer includes a 9% pay deal over 18 months and ""a number of other concessions to terms and agreements"", Royal Mail said.A spokesman said: ""We spent three more days at [conciliation service] Acas this week to discuss what needs to happen for the strikes to be lifted.""In the end, all we received was another request for more pay, without the changes needed to fund the pay offer,"" he said, adding that the union ""knows full well"" that the business is losing more than £1m a day.Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Penguin boss resigns after US blocks takeover deal,20:41 9 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/85A8/production/_127461243_books.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63920064,"The head of publishing giant Penguin Random House has resigned, citing the US decision to block the firm's $2.2bn takeover of rival Simon & Schuster.Markus Dohle will step down at the end of the year, the company said, adding that he was parting at ""his own request and on the best of mutual terms"".Mr Dohle had led Penguin since 2013, when it emerged from another big merger as the world's largest book publisher.Competition concerns scuttled the Simon & Schuster acquisition.A US judge ruled in favour of the US government, which had attempted to block the merger, arguing that the tie-up would reduce pay and opportunities for writers.""Following the antitrust decision in the US against the merger of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster, I have decided, after nearly 15 years... to hand over the next chapter of Penguin Random House to new leadership,"" Mr Dohle said.The company will continue to pursue smaller acquisitions, including in the US, Penguin's German owner Bertelsmann told Reuters.Penguin's current US boss, Nihar Malaviya, will serve as interim chief executive from 1 January.Penguin Random House was formed through the merger of the UK's Penguin with New York-based Random House in 2013.Penguin has worked with celebrated authors including Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Virginia Woolf.In more recent times it has published books by Zadie Smith, Marian Keyes and Dan Brown.Simon & Schuster's roster of writers includes Stephen King, Jennifer Weiner and former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.Mr King was among the big names to testify against the merger on behalf of the US government, which has taken a harder line against monopolies under US President Joe Biden.Bertelsmann initially said it would appeal against the US decision, but ultimately scrapped the deal. It is paying a $200m breakup fee.Mr Dohle had worked for Bertelsmann in various roles since 1994. He was boss at Random House when the firm announced the mega merger with Penguin."
Orkney Christmas businesses hit by mail strikes,20:00 9 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/5A4A/production/_127941132_orkney1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63915821,"Businesses in Orkney have said they are being hit hard by the Royal Mail strikes in the build-up to Christmas.Negotiations between the organisation and the CWU union, over pay and conditions, have stalled.With uncertainty over delivery dates, some business owners in Orkney are reporting a drop in online sales.Members of the CWU are due to continue striking on Sunday as well as on 14, 15, 23 and 24 December.Judith Glue's knitwear shop has been a fixture on Kirkwall's Broad Street since 1979.She was an early pioneer of online sales in Orkney, and now sends goods worldwide via her website.She says she has lost thousands of pounds of sales of Orcadian food hampers, as the postal strikes mean perishable items cannot be sent.""It's had quite a serious affect on our business,"" she said.""We made the decision to send them out in the first two weeks of December, but we're not guaranteeing Christmas delivery.""She said they had moved to more non-perishable items - for example less smoked salmon and farmhouse cheese.""Sadly, this has affected our suppliers as well, as we've not been able to order the same quantity as other years.""This situation has shown how essential the Royal Mail is for Orkney. I don't think people realise how much the islands rely on the postal service.""Sheila Fleet Jewellery is also based in Kirkwall, as well as having a gallery and cafe in Tankerness.They also send their goods globally, using Orkney's airmail service to get the parcels to mainland Scotland.""It's having a profound effect on our business,"" managing director Martin Fleet said.""We rely on the Royal Mail's special delivery service, it's been a lifeline to us for many years.""With the strikes coming up, our team has had to work incredibly hard to get as many parcels out as soon as we could, in order not to let any of our customers down.""He said they supported some of the reasons behind the strike, but said it had the potential to be ""absolutely devastating"" to the business.""I really hope they can find a resolution, so that the universal postal service can continue,"" he said.Last week, Royal Mail advised people to post Christmas mail earlier than usual.The CWU said staff want a pay rise to matche the soaring cost of living and accused management of trying to ""force through thousands of compulsory redundancies"".Royal Mail plans to cut 10,000 jobs by next August, which will include 6,000 redundancies.It wants to modernise how the business operates to accommodate a growth in parcel deliveries and the decline in letter volumes.Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Santander fined £108m by financial watchdog,17:00 9 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/A234/production/_122542514_gettyimages-1309469252.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63914275,"Santander has been fined £107.7m over ""serious and persistent gaps"" in its anti-money laundering controls which opened the door to ""financial crime"".The financial watchdog said the bank ""failed to properly oversee and manage"" systems aimed at verifying information provided by business customers.Santander also failed to properly monitor the money customers had going through their accounts.The bank said it was ""very sorry"" for the failings and had taken action.Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said: ""Santander's poor management of their anti-money laundering systems and their inadequate attempts to address the problems created a prolonged and severe risk of money laundering and financial crime.The failings affected the oversight of accounts held by more than 560,000 business customers between 31 December 2012 and 18 October 2017, and led to more than £298m passing through the bank before it closed accounts.The FCA said that in one case, a new customer opened an account as a small translations business with expected monthly deposits of £5,000. Within six months it was receiving millions in deposits, and swiftly transferring the money to separate accounts.Although the account was recommended for closure by the bank's own anti-money laundering team in March 2014, the FCA said that poor processes by Santander meant that it was not acted upon until September 2015.As a result, the customer continued to receive and transfer millions of pounds through its account.The City watchdog identified several other business banking accounts which Santander failed to manage correctly, leaving the bank open to ""serious money laundering risk"".Santander chief executive Mike Regnier said: ""We are very sorry for the historical anti-money laundering related controls issues in our Business Banking division between 2012-17 highlighted in the FCA's findings.""He said the bank took action to address the issues once they were identified, but accepted that its anti-money laundering controls at the time should have been stronger.""We have since made significant changes to address this by overhauling our financial crime technology, systems and processes, he said, adding that more than 4,400 Santander staff are now focused on preventing financial crime.Regulators have been busy cracking down on banks for money-laundering failures.The biggest UK fine was for NatWest, which was penalised £265m in December 2021 after it admitted three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations between 2012 and 2016. It failed to prevent money-laundering of nearly £400m by a Bradford gold trading business, which in one instance deposited £700,000 in cash into a branch in black bin bags.HSBC was also fined in December 2021, paying £64m after the FCA found ""unacceptable failings"" in its anti-money laundering systems between 2010 to 2018. The bank had previously been fined £1.4bn for failing to prevent laundering by Mexican drug cartels after an investigation by the US Department of Justice.In June this year, Credit Suisse was fined for involvement in money laundering related to a Bulgarian drugs ring. It was fined around £1.7m and ordered to pay £15m to the Swiss government.If you have information about any of the issues raised in this story and would like to speak to a BBC journalist, please email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.You can also get in touch in the following ways:If you are reading this page and can't see the form you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question or comment or you can email us at HaveYourSay@bbc.co.uk.

Is Labour really back in business?,1:45 9 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/161F/production/_127936650_mediaitem127936549.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63911618,"Labour has made its latest pitch for power to business leaders at Canary Wharf, one of London's financial hubs. Was it enough to convince them the party is a government-in-waiting?The symbolism was as important as the substance.On the face of it, Labour's business conference in Canary Wharf was to launch a report promoting and encouraging business start-ups.But it was also an opportunity for Labour to promote its pro-business credentials and further highlight its distance from the Corbyn era.Opening the conference, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the party wasn't just pro-business but ""proudly pro-business"".But more importantly, was business now more pro-Labour?Banners were proudly displayed demonstrating backing for the conference from - amongst others - HSBC and energy company SSE.But neither Sir Keir nor Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, could name a single company which was endorsing the party itself for the first time.Ms Reeves told me it was difficult for ""big businesses - certainly public limited companies - to endorse political parties"".But, she said, there had been ""a huge surge in donations"" to Labour from business.The event was partly open to the press but perhaps in a sign of nervousness, some of what Sir Keir described as ""the biggest engagement with businesses in a decade"" took place behind closed doors.A shadow minister was deployed to each table of attendees to discuss the party's plans in greater detail and to listen to concerns.When he was shadow chancellor three decades ago, Labour's John Smith embarked on a ""prawn cocktail"" offensive - City lunches to reassure the financial sector that they need not fear a Labour government.This time, attendees were wooed first by coffee and pastries, then over lunch with a noodle dish and strawberry-and-melon-infused water.Access to the one Labour-supporting business figure told me ""this is all about emphasising we are a serious party of government. We have to ram home over and over again that we are serious about business"".A Conservative-supporting attendee was less impressed with the content, but admired the organisation of the event - and said it reminded him of when former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron was on the cusp of power.But just how frank is Labour's engagement with business?I tested the water during the lunchtime break with Ms Reeves.I asked if the party had been clear that its decision to repeal 2016 trade union legislation - setting thresholds in strike ballots - would make it easier for unions to go on strike.She said the legislation hadn't ""made a blind bit of difference because when working people have had enough, they decide to take industrial action"". But she suggested private businesses were likely to be more reasonable than the government.""The business people who are here today, many of them will recognise trade unions and will work with their workers to resolve disputes,"" she said.Neither she nor Sir Keir would commit to repealing promised - or threatened - Conservative legislation on minimum service levels, stressing that it would do nothing to solve the current disputes.And now that permission has been given to a coal mine in Cumbria, would a pro-business Labour government really close it down if they come to power?""There are plenty of ways to get jobs in Cumbria and the north of England,"" she said. ""I don't think [the mine] will be open by the time of the next election. I'd be amazed if it was open.""Exporting businesses are also keen to get tariff-free access to big markets. Labour has ruled out rejoining the EU single market, the biggest market on the UK's doorstep.Politically, the party does not want to revisit the Brexit divisions of the past at the next election. But was the shadow chancellor - who opposed leaving the EU - really telling businesses that economic growth would be higher outside of the free-trade zone across the Channel?Her emphasis was to improve the Brexit deal rather than turn back the clock.""We recognise that the status quo, the Brexit deal that the government secured three years ago, it is not working for business,"" she said.She said there were ""practical things we can do to improve relations with our nearest neighbours and trading partners and as a government we'd be determined to do that"".Labour insiders know they have an opportunity to convince business that they can provide the stability they crave, though they have no longer been gifted with the contrast of a Liz Truss administration.Ahead in the polls, Labour is putting emphasis on not putting a foot wrong and creating political hostages to fortune.Appearing serious and responsible and appealing to new sources of support is seen as far more necessary than generating headlines."
Council tracks people's phones to monitor footfall,23:14 8 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/180E5/production/_127933589_phonespic.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-63907208,"A council is using people's mobile phone movements to get an insight into shoppers' habits on high streets.Conwy council's pilot tracks people who use its free wi-fi services as they move around Llandudno's Mostyn Street.The information will inform decisions around business hours and where further investment might be needed.But the issue has sparked fierce debate, with Llandudno councillor Harry Saville raising concerns about how the project may affect people's privacy.The council already has a system whereby, with their consent, the council collects data from wi-fi-users at its offices, buildings, libraries and leisure centres and uses it for marketing purposes, such as promoting events.Now, as part of this new scheme in partnership with the Welsh government, the council is able to track wi-fi-users' mobile phones in Mostyn Street by triggering sensors.The data collected contains no personal information, but gives the council a picture of movements around the street by tracking a device's media access control (Mac) address.Discussing the matter at a scrutiny committee meeting, Mr Saville questioned whether people's personal information was at risk from the scheme.""I appreciate you are not capturing any personal data, but if we think, smartphones, and most people will only have one, the Mac address, the identifier in many cases, is unique,"" he said.""So let's say I go down Mostyn Street, you are not able to tell who I am personally, my age, my other details, but you know where my phone has been, and someone would be able to link that to an individual wouldn't they, potentially?""Conwy council IT manager Neil Payne replied: ""Potentially, yes, if we had details of your phone contracts, which we don't have, or if you went to the mobile phone providers.""But he added: ""The initial purpose of it is to monitor footfall. So all it does is picks up what we call a Mac address, a unique address, no personal details at all, and it just tracks the movement of those phones.""Kinmel Bay councillor Nigel Smith dismissed Mr Saville's arguments as ""scaremongering"".""I couldn't find out what councillor Harry's Mac address is if I wanted to,"" Mr Smith said.""That's the truth of the matter. I could quite easily go out and look at a registration on a car and monitor where that car goes, and nobody worries about that.""The committee voted against Mr Saville's proposal to stop the pilot."
'We haven't had a single penny from the Post Office',20:59 8 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/17DE2/production/_127926779_sethi2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63889700,"Baljit Sethi cannot understand why it is taking so long for the Post Office to pay him compensation.""It doesn't seem like they're interested in doing anything,"" he says.He is one of thousands of sub-postmasters who lost everything, after the introduction of a faulty IT system made it appear as though money was going missing.The official inquiry into the scandal was looking into the compensation process for a third time on Thursday.The inquiry heard from government, Post Office and legal representatives, after its chairman Sir Wyn Williams said in September he was ""disappointed with the apparent lack of substantial progress to date"".The Post Office, which administers the compensation schemes, said it recognised the ""importance of ensuring that postmasters receive timely and fair compensation for the failings associated with the Horizon IT system"" and pointed to the numbers of people who had already received payments.The government says ""significant progress"" has already been made on compensation and has announced details of an additional compensation scheme that will begin work next year.But solicitors for sub-postmasters making claims say the process is too slow.Mr Sethi agrees that three years after the High Court declared the Post Office's Horizon IT system was riddled with ""bugs, errors and defects"", it is high time that people like him are properly compensated.""We haven't had a single penny,"" he says.""We've sent them so many emails, and after four or five months they reply: 'Please have patience, Mr Sethi'.""""I mean, how long can I have patience for?"" he says.Over 20 years Mr Sethi and his wife ran two post offices near Romford in east London, investing in the businesses and working long hours.He noticed the new IT system was causing shortfalls in the accounts at one of his two branches. He alerted the Post Office, but nothing was done. After ongoing erratic results from the Horizon accounting software, he lost his businesses, became bankrupt, and his reputation in the local community was destroyed. He ended up working as a low-paid night security guard, struggling to make ends meet.Other sub-postmasters were prosecuted, some spent time in prison, or had to pay back tens of thousands of pounds that they were wrongly accused of stealing.Some former sub-postmasters have suffered other financial consequences.Stefan Fountain, 65, decided to sell up and leave after his Post Office accounts started to show shortfalls, but that left him in ""an awful situation financially"".He was declared bankrupt, and ended up losing his home, and is now living in rented accommodation.Mr Fountain still owed money to creditors, and he has been told that £20,000 of his damages will go to official receivers, leaving him with £4,000.""I get quite angry and bitter when I think about it, as I've had to struggle all of my life due to the failings of the Horizon system, and yet still I am treated like this,"" he said.A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We are sincerely sorry for the impact of the Horizon scandal on the lives of victims and their families.""The Post Office, which is state-owned, runs two compensation schemes. One, the Historical Shortfall Scheme (HSS), is for people like Mr Sethi, former postmasters who had to cover discrepancies in their businesses' accounts with their own funds, but who were not prosecuted.A Post Office spokesperson said there had been over 2,300 eligible applications for the HSS.""Over 70% of applications have accepted an offer and received payment; and 95% of applicants should receive an offer by the end of this year. The scheme has also been extended to anyone who wants to submit a late application,"" he said.The Post Office said if outstanding applications had not received an offer, it was ""usually in light of a case-specific complexity"".A second scheme, the Overturned Historical Convictions (OHC) scheme, provides payments to those who were prosecuted. So far £11.3m has been paid in compensation to 77 of the 83 individuals whose convictions had been overturned, although much of that is in interim payments, and only two cases have been fully settled.The Post Office said it was ""making good progress with many more claims"".On Wednesday the government outlined the details of a third scheme, to be overseen by the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).The new scheme will compensate the 555 former sub-postmasters who brought the initial legal action, known as the Group Litigation Order (GLO), that culminated in 2019 with a settlement at the High Court, making clear for the first time the scale of the miscarriage of justice that had taken place.Those 555 sub-postmasters did receive a share of the £57m original settlement, but that was mostly absorbed by legal fees and for legal reasons the GLO group are not eligible for either of the two Post Office-run compensation schemes.The new scheme would ""ensure that these trailblazing postmasters, who did so much to uncover this injustice, receive the compensation they deserve"", Business Secretary Grant Shapps said.But solicitors representing the former postmasters said their clients were ""justifiably frustrated"" at the delays to authorising settlements.Hudgell Solicitors, in a submission ahead of Thursday's inquiry hearing, highlighted the low initial offers that some claimants were receiving, which were increased three-fold or more when challenged. The delays in the process put ""great pressure"" on claimants in financial hardship to accept the initial offer, the firm said.Howe and Co accused BEIS of ""inertia"", only making fast progress with the new compensation scheme in the build-up to a hearing at the inquiry. The HSS scheme was ""exceptionally slow"" the firm said.That has certainly been Mr Sethi's experience.He made his initial application in February 2020. Since then he has answered hundreds of questions, but still received no substantial response.Mr Sethi's son Adeep is doing his best to help his parents to keep battling through what he says is a very opaque process.""These people are in their 70s and 80s, they're sick and tired of fighting,"" he says.

Striking use of Holyrood’s tax powers,19:00 8 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/102A5/production/_127931266_adfb06be5da005fdaebb0b42c6569e6becdef45c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-63904942,"Like an advent calendar of pay disputes, there's someone on strike in public services every day until Christmas, and they go on into the New Year.Open today's door and you'll find Scottish teachers. Then it's Royal Mail, again.Next week, rail workers return to strike action, along with driving test examiners in Scotland, and Highlands and Islands airport staff.Just ahead of Christmas, Glasgow is one of the airports where inbound passengers will find hold-ups due to striking Border Force officials.Among the most controversial and consequential stoppages will be nurses and paramedics in England.Why the public services? Here are three reasons:Private sector employer, who are employers struggling to recruit and retain the workers they need, have more flexibility to put up pay in response - and are able to pass on at least some costs to customers.The most recent figures from the Office of National Statistics show average public sector pay rising 2.2% in the year to the July to September quarter, while private sector pay was up 6.6%, not including bonuses.Taking inflation into account, both sectors were worse off, but those in government service by much more. And since those pay figures for late summer, consumer price inflation has risen steeply, meaning real earnings will likely be shown to be further down.Today at Holyrood, Scottish trade unions have been lobbying for bigger pay rises next year. Most of the disputes taking place now are for pay rises in this current 2022-23 financial year.However, today's focus is on the public sector pay policy to be announced next week by John Swinney, the interim finance secretary, alongside his draft budget for 2023-24.While sympathetic to public sector workers, Scottish ministers point to the cuts Mr Swinney has had to apply to non-payroll services in order to enhance pay offers. But further pay claims are ""not affordable"", says the Scottish government.This being pantomime season, the answer from the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) this week is ""oh yes they are… and here's how…""The umbrella body for labour unions has published an analysis of what powers the Scottish government has to raise more funds in tax, and how much they could bring in.This is a sort of reverse engineering of public finance. It starts with a hope for at least a 12% increase in the public sector payroll budget, just ahead of price inflation, and then finds ways that could be funded.To those who like taxes, particularly those who like raising taxes and in progressive ways, that journey makes for quite an exhilarating read. For those on higher earnings or with a lot of wealth in physical, financial or pension assets, it might be wise to take a seat before reading on.To get to the kind of funds the STUC has in mind to fund its pay demands, its report - compiled by economic modellers at Landman Economics consultancy - starts by finding ways the public payroll could partially pay for itself.From higher pay for public sector workers come higher income tax receipts for the Scottish government, and higher National Insurance contributions for the UK one.So while pushing up the public payroll bill by 10%, or £2.4 billion, the net cost to the Scottish government can be seen as 76% of that or £1.8 billion. And including the payback to the UK government coffers, the net cost falls to 57% of the gross figure, or £1.4bn.Then the tax increases begin, starting with the Scottish government's main fiscal lever, income tax.The freezing of thresholds is a form of stealth tax as people's earnings rise through them. They look likely to remain frozen next year in Scotland, as they are doing with Jeremy Hunt at the UK Treasury. With high inflation, that 'fiscal drag' brings in vast amounts of money with minimum political pain.But the union paper goes further, looking to reduce the higher rate threshold from £43,663 to £40,000, meaning the net goes wider still.With rates on above-average earnings already one penny in the pound higher than the rest of the UK, the STUC paper suggests that rises to three pence more. So higher rate tax, currently paid on earnings above £43,663, would go up from 41 pence in the pound to 43 pence.The threshold for top or 'additional' rate tax would fall to take in earnings above £125,000, while the rate rises to 48%. And a further tax band would kick in from £75,000, at a 46% rate.How much could that bring in to the Scottish government budget? A lot depends on how people respond.High earners have bigger incentives, and better accountants, with which to switch earned income to unearned dividends (taxed from Westminster), so there would be a 'behavioural effect'.But it's very hard to say how big that would be. The more taxes rise, the bigger it would be.This modelling arrives at a figure of £387m from lowering the higher rate threshold by £3,663. The new band, between £75,000 and £125,000 could bring in £200m.Adding two pence in the pound to that rate and the ones above could bring in £220m. And with some more gains elsewhere - modest because there aren't that many very high earners in Scotland - the total comes to £867m.The modelling further suggests that the top 10% of earners in Scotland would be nearly 3% worse off. That's from the income tax measures. There are plenty more ideas for squeezing the rich.Council tax, for instance, is widely acknowledged as being ripe for reform and far from progressive. The proportion of income paid by low income households on income tax is higher than the proportional impact on those paying council tax on big homes.Measures that could be introduced swiftly would be slashing the reduced council tax rates on second and holiday homes, as well as empty properties. Then slap a surcharge on the most valuable quarter of homes, or perhaps those valued at more than £500,000.That could be progressive on those in the top half of earners, but oddly, it would not be progressive in the lower half. Some in big homes have low income.Longer term, by which they mean it's possible by 2025, council tax could be replaced by a Proportional Property Tax, meaning bills are directly related to the value of the property. Something similar was proposed 16 years ago by an independent review commissioned by Labour ministers from a panel led by a senior banker.So, for example, if everyone pays 0.7% of the value of their home, that's nearly £1,500 a year on the average owner-occupied home. And the STUC/Landman reckoning is of nearly £1bn more income than council tax currently generates. For a house worth £1m, that means a £7,000 annual bill, which is a lot more than the owner is currently paying.But they're not finished with the high earners and wealthy yet. The jackpot of STUC tax reforms would be a wealth tax.The illustrative examples suggest that one in eight households have wealth of more than £1m. Get each of them to pay 1% in cash each year, even though some are cash poorer, and the annual bill would be shy of £8,000 per average house, bringing in £1.3bn.Or try setting the threshold at £2m in wealth, which would mean tax bills averaging nearly £18,500 for 2.2% of households, bringing in an extra £500m annually.Or push it up to £10m - the seriously wealthy, and only 0.1% of households. A 1% tariff would mean a bill of £74,000 per year, and £55m for public coffers.But it's at those levels of wealth, along with higher council tax and much higher income tax that you would see most behavioural effects - tax avoidance by clever accounting, moving out of Scotland, or not moving into it.Administrative costs, it is acknowledged, would be high - perhaps 1% of takings, if a register of wealth is to be reliable. And there's a further big catch. The STUC 'fairer tax' paper takes the powers the Scottish government already has, which is intended to deny ministers the opportunity to point the finger of blame and responsibility at Westminster.The Scottish government could not introduce a wealth tax under its current powers. Yet it could empower local councils to do so. And that would make it a much more politically and administratively complex challenge.The STUC isn't finished there. It has briefer suggestions of a Land Value Tax applying to businesses, while scaling back the Small Business Bonus tax holiday for the past 14 years. It is at growing cost in revenue foregone, and with little to no evidence that it makes much difference to economic or employment growth.There's encouragement for use of tourist taxes and a frequent flyer levy is suggested on top of passenger tax.And if some of those are more difficult to introduce next financial year, the report points to council reserves as a short-term piggy bank to be raided ahead of these new sources of revenue coming on stream.Would this plan work? It would be very challenging to introduce, and could be laden with unintended consequences for economic growth and total tax revenues, perhaps going far beyond the assumptions in the economic modelling used.It is an audacious pitch that all of this extra revenue should be shovelled into the bank balances of public sector workers, and not into other elements of public funds, such as welfare benefits or capital spending on better quality infrastructure.Politically, though, it's a clever move by the unions, as an answer to those who say their pay demands cannot be funded, and to those who say Holyrood lacks tax levers. But it's not the unions who would have to persuade voters to back such a plan at an election."
What happens if I can't afford to pay my mortgage?,17:08 8 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/16212/production/_127624609_6a288c64-943d-4836-80be-1ca5b49c8741.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63486782,"The average interest rate charged by mortgage lenders is near its highest level for 14 years, adding to cost-of-living pressures.So what can those struggling to make repayments do - and how must their mortgage provider help out?There are different types of mortgages - all of which have become more costly in recent months.Mortgage rates have been rising, so the 1.6 million people on tracker or variable deals have been paying much more than a year ago.The estimated 300,000 homeowners coming to the end of a fixed deal every three months are also facing a much higher monthly bill.Typically, they could end up paying an extra £3,000 a year, the Bank of England said.That is difficult to answer. Analysts expect Bank of England interest rates to peak at about 4.75% next year.For anyone on tracker deals, at least, that means higher repayments to come.Recent data indicates that rates on fixed-rate deals have fallen slightly in recent weeks.House prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.In November, prices fell 2.3%, the biggest monthly reduction for 14 years, according to the Halifax.However, a decade or so of ultra-low mortgage rates - which many homeowners have become accustomed to - is clearly over.There is a smaller choice, but still plenty of options depending on your circumstances.An agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means that people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage, without a new affordability test, when your current deal ends as long as you are up to date with payments.A shortfall equivalent to two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.But your lender must make reasonable attempts to reach an agreement with you.In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - which regulates mortgage lenders - wrote to chief executives during the summer, reminding them they must treat customers fairly.Crucially, customers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they are going to struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must be on hand to help.Within 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:Your lender must then treat you fairly by considering any requests about changing how you pay, perhaps with lower repayments for a short period.Any arrangement you come to, the FCA points out, will be reflected on your credit file - affecting your ability to borrow money in the future - as will any missed payments.Your lender might also suggest or allow you to extend the term of the mortgage or let you pay just the interest for a certain period of time.A mortgage payment holiday enables customers to delay repayments - but not indefinitely.Lenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances - and not to those already in arrears - but the level of support offered during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.Again, this will show on your credit file.The devolved governments run some mortgage-support schemes - but the criteria can be complex. Here is a guide from the government-backed Moneyhelper website.Some people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.Repossessions are far rarer than they used to be.There are lots of stages before a lender can take such action and the whole process takes about two years.But if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice."
What are my rights if my flight is cancelled?,16:57 8 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/17154/production/_124984549_gettyimages-1311837740.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61646214,"Strike action by airport border staff is likely to cause disruption this winter, following problems for many holidaymakers flying last summer.Although airlines say that all flights are expected to operate as normal, passengers have been told to expect delays and cancellations.So what are your rights?If your flight is covered under UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or an alternative flight, regardless of how far in advance the cancellation was made.You can get your money back for any part of the ticket you have not used. So if you booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket refunded.If you still want to travel, your airline must find you an alternative flight. If another airline is flying to your destination significantly sooner, or there are other suitable modes of transport available, then you have a right to be booked onto that alternative transport instead.If you are stuck abroad or at the airport because of a flight cancellation, airlines must also provide you with other assistance until you are able to fly to your destination.This includes:If your airline is unable to arrange assistance, you have the right to organise this yourself and claim back the cost later. In this case, the Civil Aviation Authority advises people to keep receipts and not spend more than necessary.You are entitled to the same assistance if your flight is delayed by more than two hours.You may also be able to claim compensation if your flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late. Again, the amount is based on how far you are flying.If you are delayed by more than five hours and no longer want to travel, you can get a full refund.Disruption caused by things like extreme weather, airport or air traffic control employee strikes or other ""extraordinary circumstances"" are not eligible for extra compensation.However, in other circumstances - which are the airline's fault - you have a number of rights under UK law if you are flying from a UK airport on any airline, arriving at a UK airport on an EU or UK airline, or arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline.What you are entitled to depends on what caused the cancellation and how much notice you were given.If your flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, you may be able to claim compensation based on the timings of the alternative flight you are offered.The amount you are entitled to also depends on how far you were travelling. For example:If you booked a package holiday with a company that is an Abta member and your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a suitable alternative flight or a full refund."
What is happening to house prices?,16:39 8 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/114C1/production/_127494807_houseprices_gettyimages-1326578802.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-63147101,"Annual house price growth has slowed, and the latest monthly figures from both Nationwide and Halifax show a fall.This follows the Bank of England's decision to increase interest rates to 3%, meaning higher mortgage costs for many.In the last two years, prices rose steeply - by about a quarter - across most of the UK.That pace of growth was much faster than was seen after the 2008 global financial crisis, when houses lost about a sixth of their value. It took five years, on average, for prices to recover.However, prices have now started to slow, with figures from both Nationwide and Halifax showing falls between October and November.The chart above of annual, rather than monthly, growth shows that year-on-year growth is heading down towards zero.Nationwide warned the housing market looked set to ""remain subdued"" in the coming months.Monthly changes can be blips, but the UK's largest lender, Lloyds, is planning for an 8% fall next year.In November, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), which advises the government on the health of the economy - predicted that house prices will drop by 9% over the next two years.Big jumps in interest rates put pressure on the amount people can afford to offer for houses, and that means less demand.Mortgage affordability also depends on wider cost-of-living pressures like energy bills, wages and job security. The future of house prices depends on the economy as a whole.The biggest immediate effect is on people who want to move.Some sellers may decide to delay putting their homes on the market. Homeowners who are considering moving may find they have less money to spend.There were fewer property sales this year than in the 12 months leading up to last summer's surge in prices before the temporary stamp duty reduction ended.But if interest rates stay high, an increasing number of people will come off fixed-price mortgages (about 100,000 each month) to new, higher rates.Some homeowners will find higher these monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell.First-time buyers may find properties are more affordable, allowing them to get a foot on the ladder - assuming they can get a mortgage.But a drop in prices can also send shudders through the finances of homeowners who are staying put.At the most extreme, they can end up in negative equity - where the amount they have borrowed is greater than the current value of their property.With about a third of household wealth tied up in home values, falling prices can make people feel less financially secure, mean they save more than they spend.Less spending can make an economic slowdown even worse.Arrears peaked during the 2008 financial crisis, and did not rise significantly during the pandemic, helped by lenders granting payment holidays.Payment difficulties can lead to banks and building societies repossessing houses, although lenders try to avoid this.More than 200,000 properties were repossessed in the five years after the 2008 crash.As a result of Covid, repossessions were suspended between March 2020 and April 2021. In the year after they restarted, there were fewer than 4,000.When the Bank of England raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points to 3% on 3 November, it was the biggest single rise in the cost of borrowing since 1989.After the mini-budget, financial markets were forecasting that the Bank of England's interest rate would rise above 6% in 2023.However, traders now expect the peak to be under 5%. You can use the mortgage calculator above to see how rate changes affect monthly repayments.In the early 2000s property boom, 100% mortgages and cashback offers were not uncommon.But after the 2008 financial crash, mortgage lending rules were tightened.As a result, loans should leave more room for prices to fall before borrowers are stuck with negative equity.Most recent borrowers have also had their ability to pay checked against interest rates even higher than the ones we're seeing at the moment.Additional reporting by Jack Rodgers and Helena Rosiecka"

He described its production and distribution as a ""quite remarkable experience"".The first batch of coins will be given in change to customers buying something in post offices - something its chief executive Nick Read describes as a ""tremendous honour"".""December is our busiest time of the year so the coin will be entering our network in a phased manner,"" he said. ""If you don't receive the new 50p in your change on your first visit to a post office you may well get it in your change in a subsequent visit, so keep a look out for it.""More coins will be released in line with demand, replacing damaged or worn 50p coins carrying the portrait of Queen Elizabeth. There are approximately 27 billion coins circulating in the UK bearing the image of the late Queen and these can still be used to pay for things. Before decimalisation, it was common for people to carry coins featuring different monarchs in their pockets.Cash use has become far less frequent when compared to debit cards, a trend driven by the emergence of contactless cards and then accelerated by the Covid pandemic. The buying power of these coins has also been diluted by rising prices.However, there is still keen interest from consumers and collectors about the images used on coins and banknotes.The reverse side of the new 50p coin is a copy of the design used on the 1953 Crown struck to commemorate the Queen's coronation.It includes the four quarters of the Royal Arms depicted within a shield. In between each shield is an emblem of the home nations: a rose, a thistle, a shamrock and a leek.The coins follow centuries of tradition with the monarch now facing left - the opposite way to his predecessor. Profiles are alternated between left and right for successive monarchs. As with previous British kings, and unlike the Queen, he wears no crown.Other denominations will be manufactured, carrying the King's image, in line with demand."

House prices see biggest drop in 14 years - Halifax,18:30 7 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/1028D/production/_127398166_4cf6c3fe661d526a3e64a25a961c3fc9937e8294.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63886983,"UK house prices saw their biggest drop in 14 years in November, falling 2.3%, reflecting ""volatility"" in the market, according to mortgage lender Halifax.November marks the third month in a row during which prices have fallen with potential buyers playing safe by delaying purchases.The average UK house price in November was £285,579.Higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty, and the rising cost of living are all affecting the market.The annual rate of growth in property prices has now dropped from 8.2% to 4.7%.Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, said: ""While a market slowdown was expected given the known economic headwinds - and following such extensive house price inflation over the last few years, this month's fall reflects the worst of the market volatility over recent months.""Some potential home moves have been paused as homebuyers feel increased pressure on affordability and industry data continues to suggest that many buyers and sellers are taking stock while the market continues to stabilise.""However, she said that the falls should be put into context, given the rapid increase in property prices in the last few years.Property prices were up more than £12,000 compared with this time last year, and £46,403 higher than in March 2020 when the Covid pandemic began.The Halifax said Wales and the South West of England had recorded particularly sharp slowdowns in annual house price growth.Both had been at the forefront of house price inflation during the pandemic, when the so-called race for space among buyers boosted demand for rural or coastal properties.The Halifax survey, based on the lender's own data, comes shortly after the rival Nationwide Building Society said prices fell 1.4% from October to November - the largest month-on-month fall since June 2020.Mortgage rates are much higher than at any time during the last decade, although earlier this week, the average rate on a new, fixed-rate two or five-year deal fell below 6% for the first time for two months.Tomer Aboody, director of property lender MT Finance, said: ""With another fall in property prices in November, buyers and sellers are clearly demonstrating more caution due to higher mortgage rates and the ever-rising cost of living.""As with any fall in pricing, buyer sentiment and confidence is key. But considering the macro-economic and seasonal factors affecting all consumers, along with the month-on-month increases seen over the past 18 months or so, the decline needs to be put into context as it is still minimal."""

How pregnant flight crew were forced to quit,5:31 7 Dec,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/320/cpsprodpb/109E7/production/_127917086_hong-index-ashley_hong.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63238334,"""Flying was my first career, so I did not have any basis of comparison to other industries. I didn't think much about whether I was being short-changed because it applied to everyone.""When Clara Fu realised that she was pregnant, her joy quickly turned to worry.The former flight attendant for Singapore Airlines (SIA) knew she would have to quit her job, as the airline required pregnant cabin crew to resign at the end of their first trimester.She eventually returned to the role. However, she soon learned that she was expecting again.As the sole breadwinner in her family, Ms Fu told the BBC that she couldn't afford to leave her job.So she hid her pregnancy and continued flying for five months. She only resigned when a passenger noticed her baby bump.""It was difficult. I managed to carry on as usual for as long as I could,"" Ms Fu says.SIA's half-a-century-old policy, which it dropped in July, was legal in Singapore because the country does not have anti-discrimination laws, Clarence Ding from the Simmons & Simmons law firm told the BBC.""This is not to say SIA's policy was not problematic. [Singapore's employment guidelines] state that employers should implement fair employment practices,"" he says.""The guidelines do not have the force of law. It does not prescribe any penalties for non-compliance. The only reason why companies adhere to the guidelines is because the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has repeatedly stated that all employers must do so,"" Mr Ding adds.""The MOM holds the real power as it has the ability to sanction employers by scrutinising their employment practices more closely and by curtailing their work pass privileges.""Although SIA did not give a reason for the change, it comes as airlines around the world have been struggling with staff shortages after mass lay-offs during the pandemic.Under the new rules, pregnant flight crew can apply to be moved to another role for up to nine months, and return to flying after giving birth.""Eligible cabin crew who have applied for ground positions so far have been offered available positions suitable for their expertise. These jobs include administrative support in our cabin crew division,"" SIA said.Women's roles in SIA's cabin crew have been key to its appeal since it was founded half a century ago.Promoted as the ""Singapore Girl"", the airline's flight attendants wear a version of the sarong kebaya, traditional clothing worn by Peranakan women in parts of South East Asia. The uniform was designed by French couturier Pierre Balmain.New recruits attend a 14-week training programme to learn how to present themselves, prepare meals and respond to emergencies.Many women felt privileged to be in the role, says Elizabeth Low, who worked for SIA in the 1980s.""Being pregnant was not an option. No one kicked up a fuss because everyone knew. You either sacrificed your family life or your career,"" she adds.""The airline's repute, and the resulting prestige of the job has allowed it to be highly selective during its recruitment process,"" the Singapore Academy of Corporate Management said in a report.""About 10% of applicants of each recruitment drive are successful and sent for training on their first steps to becoming a Singapore Girl,"" the report added.Ashley Hong left SIA after less than two years in 2011 because she was pregnant.Although she believes pregnant crew should be stopped from flying for their safety, she wishes she had been given the option to stay with the company.""I suppose when we all signed up for this job, it was with the deep knowing that the job had its limitations and an expiry date should we become pregnant,"" Ms Hong says.""Knowing it was an eventual outcome left no room for feelings of unhappiness of any sort.""Singapore's Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) has spoken up against the practice for over a decade. The group said it had received complaints from flight crew who were forced to quit.""It was absolutely unacceptable for SIA to require employees to resign when they were pregnant. It was discriminatory and sexist,"" Aware's executive director Corinna Lim told the BBC.""Even if it is somehow legal, the practice clearly goes against the spirit of the maternity protection laws that exist in Singapore to enable mothers to pursue careers and earn a living,"" she adds.Back in 2010, SIA said it required pregnant flight crew to resign because ""the physical demands of the job mean that all our cabin crew must be fit to perform their duties"".""As a responsible employer, we would not think of compromising the physical well-being of pregnant crew and their unborn children,"" the airline said in a response published in Singapore's Straits Times newspaper.""Our cabin crew are on five-year contracts, rather than on permanent terms, and it is for the reasons stated above that the employment of female crew ceases after the first trimester of a pregnancy,"" it added.The International Air Transport Association (Iata), the industry's trade body, told the BBC it has no recommendations on the policy because ""these are HR (human resources) policies by individual companies"".Other major airlines have not required pregnant cabin crew to resign.Pregnant crew working at British Airways, Qatar Airways and Qantas are offered jobs on the ground.Meanwhile, crew working for Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's national carrier, ""may choose to take up paid ground duties or go on unpaid leave until the start of their statutory maternity leave"".""After the completion of their leave, cabin crew can return to flying duties when they have successfully passed the relevant safety training courses. These policies have been in place for over a decade,"" the airline says.Ms Lim is still concerned that SIA's requirements when it comes to flight attendants' appearance, which include a prescribed Body Mass Index (BMI) range ""may further restrict the opportunities for anyone - returning mother or no - who does not fit into the company's requirements"".SIA said in response that it maintains ""the same grooming standards for all our cabin crew"".In 2021 Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the city state planned to enshrine its guidelines on workplace discrimination into law.""Philosophically, writing [the] guidelines into the law is a major move. It signals that we do not tolerate discrimination at workplaces,"" Mr Lee said.He added that a tribunal will be created to tackle discrimination over gender, nationality, age, race, religion and disability.""The workplace has changed radically in recent years. It has forced a ground-up rethink within organisations around what kinds of policies are acceptable,"" says Mr Ding.""This is very much a by-product of the war for talent, with companies scrambling to attract the brightest and the best to work for them,"" he adds.Ms Fu, who currently works in the pharmaceutical industry, welcomed the change.She says she missed out on a S$15,000 ($10,964; £9,137) bonus, which SIA awarded for every five years of service, because of her pregnancy.""I'm lucky because my parents and parents-in-law were supportive. It would have been worse if I didn't have that,"" Ms Fu says.""As a national carrier, SIA should really be supporting women with young families. If there was better support, I might have stayed on."""
