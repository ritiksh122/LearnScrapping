Ananth Krishnan," ‘U.S. created Indo-Pacific concept to bring in India to contain China,’ says Chinese official ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-created-indo-pacific-concept-to-bring-in-india-to-contain-china-says-chinese-official/article66266771.ece,"There “is no such concept as Indo-Pacific” which was “created by the United States” to bring in partners such as India to “contain” China, a Chinese diplomat has said, reflecting Beijing’s hardening opposition to both Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy as well as regional groupings such as the Quad.“In fact, there is no such concept as an ‘Indo-Pacific in geopolitics,” Chinese diplomat and Ambassador to France Lu Shaye said in an interaction with French journalists, a transcript of which was published on Wednesday by China’s Embassy in Paris.“It is a concept created by the U.S.”, he added. “In the past, we used to talk about the Pacific or the Asia-Pacific region, never about the Indo-Pacific. Why did the Americans include the Indian Ocean? It is because they believe their Asia-Pacific allies alone are no longer enough to contain China, they want to bring in India and other U. S. allies, such as France, which considers itself an Indo-Pacific country. This is wrong.”
‘Cold War mentality’
Asked if it was “wrong” for France to consider itself as an Indo-Pacific country, he continued: “I think it is wrong for France to position itself in this way, because it is a confrontational mentality, a Cold War mentality, and that is exactly what we are against.”His comments underline Beijing’s hardening view of both the Indo-Pacific idea as well as regional groupings such as the Quad. China officially does not use the term, and refers to the region as the Asia-Pacific.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who initially dismissed the Quad as an idea that was as transient “as sea foam”, also struck a harder tone earlier this year, when he equated the U.S., Australia, India, Japan Quad grouping with the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance involving the Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the U.S. and U.K. and the AUKUS (Australia-U.K.-U.S.) defence pact.“The U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy is becoming a byword for bloc politics,” he said during China’s annual Parliament session. “It professes desire for international cooperation, but in reality is stoking regional rivalry. From Five Eyes and Quad to AUKUS…. It is by no means a blessing but a sinister move. The real goal for the Indo-Pacific strategy is to establish an Indo-Pacific version of NATO.”India has strongly pushed back against China’s invoking of NATO as a comparison, and pointed to the fact that India is not a U. S. ally and the Quad was not a military alliance. Indian officials have also rejected China’s argument that the U. S. was “stoking” recent tensions in India-China relations, which New Delhi attributes to Beijing’s aggressive posture along the Line of Actual Control. Most Chinese strategic experts, in contrast, attribute the downturn in relations to India’s increasingly close ties with the U. S.
‘Foreign forces’ behind China protests
Mr. Lu, in the interview, also accused unnamed “foreign forces” for being involved in November’s protests in China against lockdowns and restrictions under the “zero-COVID” policy, which were removed finally on December 7. Beijing had initially announced easing measures in early November, but an outbreak of cases around the country that month led to only more lockdowns, fanning public frustration and culminating in protests end-November.“Some local governments did not fully understand the central government’s policies,” he said. “We had strict policies in the past but when the central government asked to ease them, they were unable to fully understand it in the first place.”“In the beginning, the Chinese public initiated the protests to express their dissatisfaction with how local governments have failed to fully implement the central government’s policies,” he added. “But the protests were soon being taken advantage of by foreign forces... The real protests only happened on the first day. Foreign forces came into play already on the second day. Foreign forces want to destroy China and overthrow the Chinese Communist Party.... This has nothing to do with the political turmoil in 1989, it was someone who intentionally linked the two things up.”

 AP, U.K. nurses join wave of strike action to demand better pay ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-nurses-join-wave-of-strike-action-to-demand-better-pay/article66266802.ece,"Thousands of nurses walked off their jobs in England on Thursday, escalating a wave of industrial unrest in the U.K. this month as ambulance and postal workers, bus drivers and airport baggage handlers all stage strikes to demand better pay amid a cost-of-living crisis.Emergency hospital care will continue as normal, and nurses will still staff chemotherapy and neonatal and pediatric intensive care units, the Royal College of Nursing said. But many less urgent hospital treatments were expected to be affected across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Although nurses did not plan to strike in Scotland, Thursday's action was described as the biggest by nurses since the U.K.'s National Health Service was established in 1948.The Royal College of Nursing has called for a pay rise at 5% above inflation, though it has indicated it would accept a lower offer. The government has said the demand was unaffordable, and talks between the two sides collapsed Monday. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Wednesday that his government has “consistently spoken to all the unions involved in all the pay disputes.Train travel across the country also was severely disrupted this week as members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union staged a strike on Tuesday and Wednesday. They also plan to stay off the job on Friday and Saturday. The strike closed around half of the U.K.'s rail lines. Some parts of the country, including most of Scotland and Wales, will have no train service.Postal workers in the Communication Workers Union also staged a fresh 48-hour national walkout this week and have more strike days scheduled during the run-up to Christmas.

 Reuters," Harry accuses Prince William of screaming at him, his aides of leaking stories in new Netflix series ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/harry-accuses-prince-william-of-screaming-at-him-his-aides-of-leaking-stories-in-new-netflix-series/article66266508.ece,"Prince Harry and his wife Meghan piled fresh criticism on the British royal family in new episodes of their Netflix documentary series released on Thursday, accusing his elder brother Prince William of being part of media attacks.William, now heir to the throne, had screamed at him when he discussed leaving his official royal role almost three years ago, Harry said, while he also added he believed the press were responsible for Meghan having a miscarriage.In the first tranche of episodes released last week, the royals had escaped relatively unscathed. But in the final three, Harry accuses his relatives of not just failing to prevent negative coverage in the press, but actively encouraging it.""It is a dirty game. There's leaking but there's also planting of stories,"" said Harry. ""So if the comms (communications) team want to be able to remove a negative story about their principal, they will trade and give you something about someone else's principal.""He said he and elder brother William, the heir to the throne, had seen what had happened with the office of their father King Charles and agreed never to repeat it.""I would far rather get destroyed in the press than play along with this game, or this business of trading,"" Harry said. ""To see my brother's office copy the very same thing that we promised the two of us would never ever do, that was heartbreaking.""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as Harry and Meghan are officially known, stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to forge new lives in the United States away from media harassment, which the couple said had threatened to destroy their mental health.

""It was terrifying to have my brother scream and shout at me, and my father say things that just simply weren't true, and my grandmother quietly sit there and sort of take it all in,"" he said.Both Buckingham Palace and William's office, Kensington Palace, have said they would not be commenting on the documentaries.A royal source also said neither the palace nor representatives of William or other royals had been approached for comment for the series itself, contradicting a Netflix statement that said they had declined to comment.The episodes were released just hours before Charles, his wife Camilla, William and his wife Kate, along with other royals, attend a carol service at London's Westminster Abbey, which will also be dedicated to the late queen whose funeral was held there in September. 
‘It’s your brother’
In another scene from the documentary, the couple were shown talking about a former senior aide to William, who provided evidence in a successful privacy lawsuit Meghan had brought against the Mail on Sunday newspaper for publishing a letter she had written to her estranged father.In his evidence the former aide, Jason Knauf, who had also worked for the couple, suggested Meghan had been aware at the time that the letter could leak.""It's your brother. Not gonna say anything about your brother, but it's so obvious,"" Meghan said.Netflix included a statement from a representative for Knauf, which said the claims were ""entirely false"".Harry also said he believed the stress of the case against the Mail had caused Meghan to lose their baby.""I believe my wife suffered a miscarriage because of what the Mail did,"" he said. ""I can say from what I saw, that miscarriage was created by what they were trying to do to her.""There was no immediate comment from the paper.
Accusations against the couple
While the couple have won awards and plaudits from some across the Atlantic for their charitable and human rights work, back in Britain, the press accuses them of seeking to make tens of millions of dollars from Netflix and others by using their royal status to constantly attack the monarchy.Newspapers have also cited former unnamed royal aides challenging the couple's narrative in the documentaries, saying there were inaccuracies in their accounts.""The truth is that negative stories about Harry and Meghan only began to leak out when their behaviour became so obnoxious that it was impossible to hide,"" wrote Rebecca English, the Royal Editor for the Daily Mail.

 AFP," Two killed in Russian shelling in Kherson, says Ukraine ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-killed-in-russian-shelling-in-kherson-says-ukraine/article66266437.ece,"Russian shelling on December 15, 2022, killed two people in the southern city of Kherson, the Ukrainian presidency said, in the latest such bombardment since Kyiv’s forces recaptured it last month.“The enemy hit the centre of the city again. One hundred metres from the Kherson region administrative building,” the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said on social media.
“There is information about two people killed. Emergency services are on site.”
Russian forces seized Kherson — which had a pre-war population of nearly 300,000 people — shortly after invading Ukraine in February.Ukraine’s army recaptured the city last month in a significant military and symbolic defeat for Moscow.Russian forces pulled back to the opposing bank of the Dnipro river that runs along Kherson and have since been shelling the city repeatedly, damaging key infrastructure.
Tymoshenko said earlier Thursday that Russian attacks across the entire southern Kherson region over the previous 24 hours had left three dead and 13 more injured.

 AP, U.N. peacekeeper killed after attack in southern Lebanon ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-peacekeeper-killed-after-attack-in-southern-lebanon/article66266358.ece,"An Irish U.N. peacekeeper was killed and several others wounded after unidentified attackers opened fire on a convoy in southern Lebanon, Irish and Lebanese military officials said Thursday.The Irish Defense Forces said in a statement said that a pair of armored vehicles carrying eight Irish UNIFIL peacekeeping troops were fired at as they drove north, toward Beirut, Tuesday night from the town of Al-Aqbiya.The Irish military added that one of the three wounded soldiers is in serious condition. It did not identify the assailants.UNIFIL confirmed that one peacekeeper was killed and three were wounded.“Our thoughts are also with the local civilians who may have been injured or frightened during the incident,” UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said, adding that “details are sparse and conflicting.” Tenenti added that UNIFIL is coordinating with the military and trying to “determine exactly what happened.”Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin expressed his condolences in a statement on Twitter.“It is a reminder that our peacekeepers serve in dangerous circumstances, at all times, in the cause of peace,"" he said.Cell phone videos circulated online shows one of the two UNIFIL vehicles speeding to leave the area while it was shot at. Some residents were visible filming the incident. Another showed the vehicle had rolled over after crashing into the aluminum shutters of a building, with a wounded peacekeeper on the on ground beside it. Scuffles between southern Lebanon residents and UNIFIL troops are not uncommon. In January, unknown perpetuators attacked Irish peacekeepers in the southern town of Bint Jbeil, vandalizing their vehicles and stealing items. The residents accused them of taking photographs of residential homes, though the U.N. denied this.UNIFIL was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after a 1978 invasion. The U.N. expanded its mission following the 2006 war, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Lebanon-Israel border to help the Lebanese military extend their authority into their country’s south for the first time in decades. That resolution also called for a full cessation of Israeli-Hezbollah hostilities, which has not happened.

 AP," Pakistan: Afghan Taliban shell border town, killing civilian ",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-dead-nine-injured-in-bomb-blast-in-pakistans-northwest/article66266105.ece," Pakistani authorities on Thursday said one person was killed and 11 were wounded when Afghan Taliban forces fired mortars toward civilians near the southwestern Chaman border crossing, reflecting increasing tension between the neighboring nations.The latest violence follows a series of deadly incidents and attacks that have strained relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers in recent months. It was not immediately clear what preceded the shots near Chaman, a key trade route between the two sides.Thursday's ongoing violence came days after seven Pakistani civilians were killed in the across-border shelling by the Taliban forces. No military spokesman was immediately available for comment and there was also no comment from the Afghan Taliban. Akhtar Mohammad, a doctor at a hospital in Chaman, said staff there received 12 wounded people following the clashes. One of them later died and some of the injured were listed in critical condition. Abdul Hameed Zehri, a government administrator in the town of Chaman in Baluchistan province, also confirmed the casualties. Security officials say Pakistan’s army responded to the Afghan fire, but did not give further details. Authorities say mortars fired by the Afghan Taliban forces also hit a truck near Chaman. They accused the Afghan Taliban forces of intentionally targeting the civilian population, The officials said the exchange of fire had subsided and Pakistani authorities were in contact with the Afghan Taliban rulers in Afghanistan to prevent any further escalation.Afghanistan’s Taliban seized the Afghan capital of Kabul last year. Since then, the countries have traded fire mainly over lingering disputes about Pakistan's construction of a fence along the Afghan border. Incidents of militant attacks on Pakistani security forces have also increased since the country's new army chief Gen. Asim Munir took the charge on Nov. 29 and replaced Qamar Javed Bajwa.On Thursday, U.S. CENTCOM chief Gen. Erik Kurilla visited Pakistan and met with Munir in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, according to a military statement. The two military leaders discussed a range of issues, including the regional stability and security cooperation. The statement said Kurilla also visited the northwestern border town of Torkham near Afghanistan.Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Embassy in Kabul came under gunfire in an attack that was later claimed by the Islamic State group. Pakistani officials at the time had called the incident an attack on its envoy there. Islamabad also has said Afghanistan’s rulers are sheltering militants who carry out deadly attacks on its soil.

General Assembly is on Friday due to approve the report, which also deferred a decision on rival claims to Libya's U.N. seat. The nine-member U.N. credentials committee includes Russia, China and the United States.The deferment of the decisions leaves the current envoys in the seats for their countries, diplomats said.Competing claims were again made for the seats of Myanmar and Afghanistan with the Taliban administration and Myanmar's junta pitted against envoys of the governments they ousted last year. U.N. acceptance of the Taliban administration or Myanmar's junta would be a step toward the international recognition sought by both.The U.N. General Assembly last year backed postponing a decision on the credentials of Myanmar and Afghanistan.A rival claim was also made this year for Libya's U.N. seat — currently held by the Government of National Unity in Tripoli — by a ""Government of National Stability"" led by Fathi Bashagha and backed by a parliament in the country's east.The U.N. credentials committee met on December 12 and agreed, without a vote, to ""postpone its consideration of the credentials"" for Myanmar, Afghanistan and Libya ""and to revert to consideration of these credentials at a future time in the seventy-seventh session,"" which ends mid-September next year.The Taliban seized power in mid-August last year from the internationally recognised government. When the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, the ambassador of the government they toppled remained the U.N. envoy after the credentials committee deferred its decision on the seat.Myanmar's junta seized power from Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in February last year.

Economic and Social Council on a draft resolution to oust Iran from the principal global intergovernmental body dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and women empowerment.The Economic and Social Council adopted on December 14 the draft resolution, introduced by the U.S., on the removal of Iran from the membership of the Commission on the Status of Women for the remainder of its 2022-2026 term, citing its oppression of women and girls in the Islamic Republic.The resolution was adopted by a recorded vote of 29 in favour to eight against - Bolivia, China, Kazakhstan, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Russia, Zimbabwe and 16 abstentions, including by Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Mauritius, Mexico, and Thailand.Also read: Protest-hit Iran abolishes ‘morality police’Through the draft 'Removal of the Islamic Republic of Iran from membership in the Commission on the Status of Women for the remainder of its 2022-2026 term’, the Economic and Social Council expressed serious concern over the actions of the Government of Iran since September 2022.It said Iran continuously undermined and increasingly suppressed the ""human rights of women and girls, including the right to freedom of expression and opinion, often with the use of excessive force, by administering policies flagrantly contrary to the human rights of women and girls and to the mandate of the Commission on the Status of Women, as well as through the use of lethal force resulting in the deaths of peaceful protestors, including women and girls.""The resolution decided to remove Iran “with immediate effect” from membership in the Commission on the Status of Women for the remainder of its 2022–2026 term.Iran has been rocked by protests since the September 16 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after being detained by the country's morality police.Also read: Iranian general acknowledges over 300 dead in unrestAt least 475 people have been killed in the demonstrations amid a heavy-handed security crackdown, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that's been monitoring the protests since they began. Over 18,000 have been detained by authorities.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the vote by the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to remove Iran from the U.N.’s Commission on the Status of Women sends an “unmistakable message” of support from around the world to the brave people of Iran, and in particular to Iranian women and girls, who remain undaunted despite the brutality and violence perpetrated against them by the Iranian regime.“The protests across Iran, triggered by the tragic death of Mahsa Amini while in the custody of the so-called “morality police,” reveal an Iranian population craving the universal human rights to which every person worldwide is entitled,” he said.Also read: Explained | Mahsa Amini and the widespread protests in Iran After the draft was adopted, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters that following Amini’s death, tens of thousands of Iranians said enough is enough. “The people have taken to the streets and made their voices heard. They are standing for women, for life, and for freedom,” she said.“The United States has long stood for gender equality and basic human rights. We had to act. Iranian women have clearly called for us, here at the United Nations, to remove Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women. It was a sensible request. Iran’s membership directly undermines the commission’s work. Its membership was a stain on our credibility,” she said. “Today, we removed that stain.”
Iran blames U.S. after being removed from U.N. rights body
Iran’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the U.N. Amir Saeid Iravani said the draft resolution was yet another evidence of the United States' hostile policy toward Iranian people, particularly Iranian women, which is being pursued under the guise of defending human rights and in the form of a removal policy that is specific to the United States and its allies.He said the U.S. request is entirely illegal as the Council members are fully aware that there is no precedent in the Council's practice of terminating an elected member's participation in a functional commission for any alleged reason, nor it is supported by the Council's rule of procedures.“It is not at all unexpected that the United States is taking such unlawful action against Iran given its long-standing hostility toward the Iranian people, but if carried out, it would be exceedingly dangerous to the U.N. System's integrity,"" Mr. Iravani said.""It contravenes the letter and spirit of the U.N. Charter, notably its basic notion of sovereign equality of states in membership with meaningful and equal participation in all multilateral forums, which has been recognised as the main pillar of multilateralism and the U.N. System. This illegal conduct might also create a dangerous precedent with far-reaching consequences,” he said.U.N. director at Human Rights Watch Louis Charbonneau said the removal of Iran from the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women is a “welcome"" step toward holding the Iranian leadership accountable for its long history of discrimination and cruelty towards women and girls.“But today’s justified action by U.N. member countries is a far cry from real accountability for those responsible for the security forces’ lethal violence against protesters after the death of Mahsa Amini, including many women and girls, and the execution of protesters after hasty unfair trials.""What’s needed is urgent coordinated pressure on Iran to end its campaign of violence, credible prosecutions of individuals who are directly responsible for these appalling violations of human rights, and an end to the severe discrimination against women,"" Mr. Charbonneau said.The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.A functional commission of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), it was established by the ECOSOC resolution of June 1946. The Commission comprises 45 Member States of the United Nations.The commission consists of one representative from each of the 45 member states elected by the Economic and Social Council on the basis of equitable geographical distribution. Members are elected for a period of four years.

 AP, G7 agrees $15.5 billion energy deal with Vietnam to cut emissions ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g7-agrees-155-billion-energy-deal-with-vietnam-to-cut-emissions/article66265921.ece,"A group of nine rich industrialized nations approved a deal to provide Vietnam with $15.5 billion to help the Southeast Asian nation move faster from coal power to renewable energy, cutting its climate-damaging pollution.The Group of Seven major economies, along with Norway and Denmark, said in a statement that the aim is to help Vietnam reduce its emissions to “net zero” by 2050, a goal that experts say needs to be met globally to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).The Just Energy Transition Partnership with Vietnam is among a series of agreements that developing and rich nations are negotiating. The first such deal was signed with South Africa last year, and a similar agreement was reached with Indonesia last month.“Vietnam is a dynamic, emerging economy at the heart of Southeast Asia,"" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. “The investment we are making today means the country can cut its emissions while simultaneously creating new jobs and growth.”The U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States comprise the G-7.U.S. climate envoy John Kerry, a veteran of the U.S. war in Vietnam, had made Vietnam a focus of his climate work for the Biden administration. Kerry took repeated trips there to urge Vietnamese leaders to call off pending coal-fired power projects and to team up with wealthier nations on cleaner energy instead.U.S. President Joe Biden said the deal would help Vietnam “deliver long-term energy security,” create opportunities for the country's population and advance ""the fight against the global climate crisis.”“Today’s announcement is an important step, but there is still a long way to go,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The $15.5 billion of funding will come from public and private sources over the coming three to five years, much of it in the form of loans, according to the agreement.By using the money to expand its electricity grid and increase renewable energy production, Vietnam will be able to bring forward its target for peaking emissions from 2035 to 2030. The country will also raise its 2030 target for electricity from renewable sources to 47% from a previous forecast of 36%.The successful delivery of these ambitious targets is expected to result in around 500 megatons (0.5 billion tonnes) of cumulative emissions saved by 2035.

He also had placed as a runner-up on “So You Think You Can Dance” and later judged season 17 of the dance competition show.The Alabama native studied dance performance at Southern Union State Community College and Chapman University.His love of dancing permeated through all aspects of his life as he aspired to emulate greats like Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.“My personal opinion: The greatest of all time had to be Gene Kelly, man. Gene Kelly, because he’s a guy’s guy. I love Fred Astaire, but Fred Astaire was so smooth, and it was great. He was so classy,"" Boss said in an interview with the Associated Press in 2014. ""But Gene Kelly — he could be like somebody’s dad, who just decided to get up off the couch and dance around and clean the kitchen up.”Boss posted dance videos on TikTok with his wife, who is also a professional dancer, with their children making guest appearances.Celebrities like Questlove, Kerry Washington and Carrie Ann Inaba posted on social media in mourning.“I have no words man.

Everyday is a winding road and you just may never know who is on the edge,” Questlove posted on Instagram.“Twitch brought joy and love to people all over the world through music and through dance. My heart is heavy today for his family and all of those who knew and loved him,” Washington also posted on Instagram.“He was a special one. A good man, a husband, an artist, a dancer, an entertainer, a bright light…He was extraordinary. He could do anything and he did it with a joy and grace and some swagger. Twitch, I’m at a loss… my heart seems to be frozen… like I don’t want to exhale, hoping that maybe if I don’t exhale, that someone will correct this horrible mistake. And all will be okay again,” Inaba, a “Dancing with the Stars” judge, posted on Instagram.He is survived by his wife and three children.

 PTI, China removes 6 diplomats from U.K. after protester assaulted ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-removes-6-diplomats-from-uk-after-protester-assaulted/article66265728.ece,"China's government has removed a Chinese consul general and five of his staff following the assault on a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester at the Chinese consulate in Manchester, Britain's foreign secretary said on Thursday.James Cleverly said British police wanted to question the six officials over the assault on protester Bob Chan, who said masked men came out from the consulate building during a peaceful protest in October, dragged him into the consulate grounds and beat him up.Police said officers at the scene had to intervene and remove Mr. Chan, who suffered injuries to his face and back.Mr. Cleverly said Britain's Foreign Office requested Beijing waive the diplomatic immunity of the six officials to allow police investigating the matter to question them.“In response, the Chinese Embassy, acting on instructions from Beijing, notified His Majesty's Government that the functions of the Consul General in Manchester have come to an end and he has returned to China,” Mr. Cleverly said.He added that the other staff have “either left the United Kingdom or will shortly do so.” Mr. Chan welcomed Thursday's development in a statement.“It has been two months since I was attacked in Manchester by staff members of the Chinese Consulate,” he said.“What happened on 16 October 2022 was unacceptable and illegal, and the withdrawal of these Chinese diplomats gives me a sense of closure.” The incident, which was captured on video, had increased tensions between Britain and China. China's foreign ministry maintained that Mr. Chan had illegally entered the consulate, and that Chinese diplomatic staff have the right to maintain security on their premises.Hong Kong is a former British colony and Britain has offered residency to tens of thousands of the city's residents since a sweeping crackdown on civil and political rights there following a wave of anti-Beijing protests in 2019.China has declared a pledge it made to London to maintain those rights until 2047 - a document registered with the United Nations - to be null and void.Last month, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared that the U.K.'s “golden era” of ties with China was over in his first major speech on foreign policy, describing China's growing authoritarianism as a “systemic challenge to our values and interests.” Some British politicians had called for the Chinese diplomats to be expelled following the incident.In response to Britain's demands, the Chinese Embassy in the U.K. issued a statement denying all wrongdoing and saying Cleverly made “irresponsible comments by distorting facts.” It repeated its contention that protesters “illegally intruded into the consulate premises and assaulted consulate officials, thus gravely undermining the safety and dignity of consulate officials.” China has “launched solemn representations with the U.K.,” it said, implying that retaliatory action could follow.“The U.K. side must be clear that reciprocity is an essential principle in diplomacy. Any act that undermines China's interests will definitely be met with forceful responses,” it said.
