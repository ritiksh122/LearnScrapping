Just Ask Modern Day BritainImage Credit: BBCLook at the state of Britain — and shudder. The stories and statistics are staggering, astonishing, and shocking. The once-vaunted NHS’s waiting list is now longer than…the entire country of Denmark. Millions can’t afford to pay basic bills. Shortages of basics — eggs, antibiotics — are becoming commonplace. Diseases like strep throat are killing kids. Getting an ambulance has become something near impossible, and yes, people are dying because of it. Strikes are set to begin, from nurses, paramedics, teachers — and the government refuses to negotiate, because…what…it wants the country to break?Modern-day Britain is a contemporary horror story. What happens when a society goes this badly wrong? How does a society end up here — plunging backwards into Dickensian poverty and Victorian disease, by way of Orwellian Big Lies? And where does it all end for Britain, anyways? Is there a road back to anything like modernity?Context, in cautionary tales like this, is everything. Britain’s begins here. Not so long ago, it was the envy of the world. The NHS was the world’s finest health service, the BBC one of it’s finest broadcasters, and so forth. Britain occupied a privileged position in the world — a gateway to Europe, a special friendship with America.So what happened? Something genuinely, remarkably strange did. The world was hit by the financial crisis of ‘08, and after that…well, let me try putting the story a different way.We all know how Britain got here, in a certain sense. Brexit. Xenophobia. Nationalism. A series of governments, each more incompetent than the last. Voters turned to them in desperation to…to what? To solve problems which were becoming intractable. Economic stagnation, labour and goods shortages, a lack of decent jobs or housing, and so forth. A sense of despair and pessimism had set in, and Britain was beset by problems, seemingly, from every possible angle. And then Brexit happened.But the fullness of the story goes much deeper, sadly, even than that.The astonishing part of the story is better told like this. Britain was once the envy of the world, and it had no special or extraordinary problems. I don’t mean that it had no problems. Sure it did. But it had the same problems as the rest of the rich world, more or less, and often to a lesser degree than most of its peers. That list of problems is by now well-known, precisely because it cuts across rich nations — deindustrialization, an entrenched underclass, a declining middle class, rising inequality, and so forth.And yet Britain, let me say it again, had no special or extraordinary problems. None. The afflictions on this list of problems cutting across rich nations often hit Britain less than its peers. Take the example of an entrenched underclass — in Europe, that’s a far more acute problem, made of social groups who staunchly refuse, often, to integrate and accept European values. Britain had an entrenched underclass — but it was mostly British. Or take deindustrialization. It’s true that Britain’s north — the home of the industrial revolution, after all — had suffered greatly. But compared to America’s Rust Belt? Its towns and cities were doing much, much better — they had more investment, more of a sense of community, still extant social ties, they didn’t have the epidemic of deaths of despair that set in in America, and that’s not my opinion, it’s an empirical fact.The point that needs to be made and understood is both striking and bizarre. Britain was in a relatively good position. In the league table of rich nations, Britain was doing pretty well. It didn’t have any extraordinary, special problems.Problems of the kind that you might think would lead people out of their minds, into the arms of demagogues, and off the nearest set of jagged cliffs, lashing out in rage, despair, and idiocy.Do you see my point a little bit? When nations make cataclysmically self-destructive choices, it’s usually because they’re beset by equally cataclysmic problems. And they choose the wrong option, simply enough. They face, like many poor countries do, a Hobson’s choice between investing in the services they desperately need, or paying off sky-high interest forever. Or between building critical infrastructure, and educating millions of people instead. On and on such brutal choices — better called dilemmas — go.Britain didn’t face any such choices, because it didn’t have any extraordinary or special problems. It was another rich country, and one that was doing well pretty well actually, thank you very much. From the turn of the century, to the late 2010s or so, much of the rich world — and obviously much of the poor one — from America right down to Taiwan, would have killed to be in Britain’s shoes: a nation with an expansive social contract, a rich set of public goods, a strikingly high standard of living, and a generally wise and peaceful populace.So what happened? You see, this part of the story often goes untold. And yet it’s crucial. The really strange thing about Britain isn’t that Brexit happened — it’s that Brexit happened and it shouldn’t have. There were no special or extraordinary problems to solve, with a radical, total, final solution, like isolating yourself from your friends and making yourself a pariah. Nothing afflicted Britain — not even remotely — that should have caused such a kind of shock therapy.So…again…and sorry to repeat myself, but…what happened? Well, if you get the point I’m trying to make, it’s precisely that Brexit happened because Brits were led to believe that they did have extraordinary and special problems. Which could only be solve with a kind of extraordinary and special set of solutions, too. Britain would require a new position in the world — “global Britain.” It’s entire social attitudes were to have to change — it was going to have to be a “hostile environment.” Its economy would have to be “leveled up.”This bizarre argot began to emerge — a kind of literal Orwellian doublespeak. This is the language of Brexiters, and by now it’s the language of Britain. Britain has no plan or agenda or vision for the future now beyond this bizarre doublespeak. None. And that’s terrifying, but not just for the obvious reason — for an even deeper one.Nobody much was left by the time this strange lexicon — the Big Lies — began to take over, and then permeate the entire nation’s consciousness, by way of being repeated everywhere so often that they simply became accepted home truths, that every sensible person knew were facts — nobody was left to point out the painfully, blindingly obvious. What was all this stuff — this radical revolution Britain was having, isolating itself from the world, alienating its friends, making an embittered xenophobe of the average person — what was all this meant to solve? Britain had gone through the looking glass — but nobody pointed it out, or at least nobody much did.Nobody said: hold on, wait — Britain has no special or extraordinary problems — just the same everyday afflictions the entire rest of the rich world, and much of the poor one, did, too. There’s no reason for any of this. It’s delusional. Why are we to hate and attack…Europe? How is that going to solve the problems we have when Europe has precisely the same ones? How can that possibly work? What are we trying to solve here, if not a set of problems which don’t really exist, with a set of false “solutions” which can never be undone? And how…Orwellian…is all that?This is why the world looked on baffled at Britain as Brexit changed everything about it. It wasn’t just that the world was horrified by a xenophobic, aggressive, literally “hostile” Britain, puffing out its chest, and shouting at everyone how much it didn’t like them. It wasn’t even that the world was bewildered by the idea that “doing” a “trade deal” with Australia or Indiana was somehow going to replace frictionless trade, not to mention the right to live and work in, the entire European Union.More than that, the world was absolutely staggered by the backwardness of this shocking state of affairs: the obvious truth that Britain didn’t have the level of problems that necessitated shock therapy, the wholesale reinvention of the social contracts, politics swinging off the charts extreme, a total transformation in social attitudes. By any objective set of measures, from the rest of the world’s point of view, Britain had been doing pretty well.But Britain had come not to believe any of that. Through this constant barrage of by now what were ubiquitous Big Lies, the average person had come to believe that Britain was in parlous state, which did require a sea change in everything, from foreign affairs to what the economy was to what public goods existed to what the social contract was. And so Britain did something astonishing….it ripped everything up.When I say everything, I mean everything. Today, the Britain of the 2000s — the one forged by Thatcherite conservatism and Blairite liberalism, both forms of pragmatism — doesn’t exist anymore. It stopped existing after Brexit, like the old saying about how bankruptcy happens. At first slowly, and then all at once. I mean that quite literally. The NHS? It’s in a state of collapse. Good luck getting an ambulance, grandma, you’re going to need it. All those “trade deals” that were sure to come, as the world beat down a “global Britain’s” door? They never materialized, quite obviously, Britain being a net importer, not an exporter, and so today, its economy is in ruins, trade off by double digits. The social contract has literally stopped working, and is basically completely dysfunctional — one of the government’s more bizarre “ideas” for Brits to just get through this winter was for doctors to prescribe…heating. Think about how Dickensian that is for a second.The Britain that used to be doesn’t exist anymore. You can see it in everything. Its bands don’t tour Europe, because they can’t afford it. Oxford Street’s megastores lie shuttered and dark. The once wise and gentle and funny Brit, a character admired the world over, is now better known as the buffoon who ruins European tourist capitals, trying to out-American Americans, who by contrast, have become, after the Trump years, gentler and more tolerant. The old Britain doesn’t exist anymore, and in its place is now a country in…what?Words are scarcely adequate to really describe it. Chaos? Ruin? Despair? Abject misery? Widespread poverty? Total dysfunction? All these are true, and yet none really capture the fullness of the portrait. The minister who refused to negotiate with the nurses’ union was said to have done it because the head of the union was a woman. LOL — what century is this? Who are these people? The Taliban? Is this a joke? Sadly, it’s reality. And it stretches on and on.Let me now make the point I’m trying to make. It’s very simple, and it goes like this. Brexit created the very problems that its Big Lies said it was going to “solve.” Of course, back then, those problems didn’t exist in the first place. But now…they do. That is an incredibly bad position for a country to be in.That’s abstract, so let me make it concrete. Take the economy. Before, Britain had the same economic problem that stretches from America to France. Deindustrialization. What do these former industrial regions do, now that jobs and industries are being shipped offshore? It’s a problem, but again, it wasn’t especially British. And it didn’t exist in the form that Brexit posited it — our entire economy’s broken, and we need to reinvent the whole thing, a whole new economy has to come to be, or else we’re done. That wasn’t true, because, well, Britain was ticking along pretty well, on the whole, even if, just as in France and America, deindustrializing regions needed investment and vision and guidance.And yet now Brexit really has made Britain’s economic position in the world…untenable. You see, now Britain has to go out there and replace the volume of trade its lost with the EU, and it’s a tremendous amount — somewhere between 15% and 40% of trade, depending on how you count it. But to do that, it has to strike trade deals, which obviously haven’t materialized. They haven’t materialized because being a net importer, well, Britain has little to offer. And so now Britain is left in a seriously shaky position — it’s getting poorer, fast, as trade dries up, and yet, without really reinventing its economy as a net exporter, that decline isn’t going to stop anytime soon.You might say, well, that’s not such a Big Deal — just get out there and export stuff! Hey — that’s how China and South Korea rose from poverty. Can’t Britain do it, too? The answer to that question is: theoretically yes, and practically, LOL, no.You see, this revolving door of leaders that Britain has had post-Brexit now face an impossible problem. They didn’t have extraordinary problems to solve before, but now Brexit has created the very extraordinary and special problems it purported to solve. Now Britain really does have a major, major, historic economic problem, which will last generations. Now it really does have a crisis of public goods, meaning that as poverty grows, there’s less left over to fund the NHS and BBC — a classic cycle of decline, in which impoverishment means less basic and critical services for the average person. Now, Britain has all the problems Brexit once lied about it having.But it doesn’t have the resources left to solve them. You see, back then, when Brexit lied about Britain having all these problems — not having enough money to pay for the NHS, a shattered economy that require a whole new position in the world, it not being good enough to be the gateway to Europe and America anymore, a whole new social contract, based on xenophobia and hate for anyone who wasn’t “really” British — well, back then, Britain had resources it doesn’t have today. Three kinds, in particular. It had friends, money, and leadership. Today, it has none of those things. And so it has no plan, no agenda, no vision for how it is going to survive, compete, subsist, exist, in the very near future. None.If you think I’m kidding, let’s take another example. Leadership? Britain’s bizarre leaders recently proposed, as a “solution” to its self-made energy crisis, opening up a new…coal mine. LOL. That doesn’t just undermine climate change progress or any such idealistic stuff — it cuts far closer to home. The US State Department issued a withering response. And if you understand diplomat-ese, then you know that it’s their way of saying, good luck jokers, you just made a trade deal with America even more impossible than it already was.Maybe you see my point a little bit. Reopening coal mines? As a solution to…powering your country in the 21st century? Is this a joke? Did the ghost of Dickens pick up the pen? Is Tiny Tim going to work there, so grandma can afford heat? Meanwhile, America and Europe are busy negotiating over the actual future that sensible countries are planning for. In response to Biden’s new vision — America as a net exporter of chips and clean energy and manufacturing, which is a fantastic idea — Europe quaked a little bit in its boots, and began negotiating furiously with America to be part of its industrial strategy for this next economy. Who wasn’t part of all this? Britain — because, well, it’s busy reopening coal mines, like some kind of idiot cousin.Let’s do another example — a really chilling one. Paramedics are going on strike, because they’re underpaid, so there aren’t enough of them to do things like respond normally to emergency ambulance calls, which is, you know, their job. The government’s refused to negotiate with them, because, well — LOL — it’s busy blaming immigrants. Britain’s labour shortage is so acute that there’s no way — none — they can be solved without immigration. Those labour shortages exist because Britain basically kicked huge numbers of Europeans out — doctors, nurses, paramedics, and so forth. Now, it doesn’t have enough to supply basic levels of healthcare to the populace. Think about how crazy that is for second — but that’s not even the crazy part yet.The really crazy part is that both sides of British politics are now busy scapegoating immigrants. The Labour Party is blaming immigrants for problems like a broken NHS — when immigrants are the only way it’s ever going to be fixed. If you think I’m kidding, go ahead and imagine American healthcare without all those nice Asian and Indian doctors, and think to yourself how hard it’d be get a doctor’s appointment then. Modern economies need immigration to power higher living standards, even if nobody much wants to champion it. But for a party like Labour — on the center left — to be hating on immigrants in terms more vitriolic than many American Republicans?Something’s very wrong with that. That something isn’t even just that Britain now effectively has two hard right wings, the left now aping the right. It’s that even the center left is now part of the vicious cycle of making Brexit create the very problems it once purported to solve. Think back to Brexit — the idea was that Brexit would fix the NHS. The NHS wasn’t even in a major crisis then — just a minor one, thanks to several years of underinvestment. But now, even Labour’s viciously hating on immigrants as a way to fix the NHS…which is a complete denial of reality. Even Labour’s out there pretending that “trade deals” with, LOL, India, are going to replace double digit losses in trade with Europe — and the consquent shattering, light-speed decline in living standards such a thing entails, as businesses shutter, people get poorer, and there’s less left over for the public purse.Let me put all that now in an American way, which is the easiest way to really understand it. Both sides in British politics are now gaslighting Britain. Instead of offering anything — anything — remotely like a vision, agenda, or plan for the future. Biden is building chip factories and investing so heavily in green energy and manufacturing that Europe’s shaking. Britain…anything? Reopening coal mines. Refusing to pay paramedics more so that people can get ambulances. Blaming immigrants for the woes of the “real” Brit, a problem that Brexit created, by causing economy-shattering labour force shortages. On and on it goes.Both sides in British politics are gaslighting Britain. They’re telling Brits that recent history didn’t happen. That the problems Britain faces now appeared, mysteriously, out of the numinous ether. Not that Brexit created them, because that’s what Big Lies do — create the problems they purport to solve. From shattering the economy to depriving it of labour to cratering living standards and the currency — Brexit created all these problems. And clinging onto its flotsam — xenophobia, the absurdity of trying to strike trade deals with countries vastly poorer, aggression and hostility directed at former friends, blaming nurses and paramedics and teachers and immigrants — none of that is remotely a solution. It’s not a solution in normal times, and it’s definitely not a solution to the greatest self-inflicted calamity in modern history.So. Does Britain have a future? Sure, a Dickensian one. Things are going to get much, much bleaker. You see, when both sides in politics are busy gaslighting people — instead of offering anything remotely like a real agenda, vision, or plan — where can a country go? Britain is getting poorer, fast, in shocking ways, from people unable to afford heat, to shortages of antibiotics, to a lack of ambulances, doctors, and nurses — the list just goes on and on — and these problems require real solutions.Part of those real solutions will involve admitting that Brexit was in fact the most cataclysmic act of self-destruction in the modern history of rich nations. Even America’s pulled ahead of Britain — something unthinkable even a short decade ago. Europe, too, has a future, made of plans, investments, ideas, agendas. Asia does, too, Africa’s arriving, as well. Britain is almost alone in this world — a nation bereft. With no plan for a perilous century. Just Big Lies, it keeps repeating to itself, in ever-widening circles, as if they’re going to fix anything. This is its warning, its lesson — and its tragedy.UmairDecember 2022How Britain’s Destroying ItselfWhat Happens When a Country Decides to Destroy Itself?

And if you understand diplomat-ese, then you know that it’s their way of saying, good luck jokers, you just made a trade deal with America even more impossible than it already was.Maybe you see my point a little bit. Reopening coal mines? As a solution to…powering your country in the 21st century? Is this a joke? Did the ghost of Dickens pick up the pen? Is Tiny Tim going to work there, so grandma can afford heat? Meanwhile, America and Europe are busy negotiating over the actual future that sensible countries are planning for. In response to Biden’s new vision — America as a net exporter of chips and clean energy and manufacturing, which is a fantastic idea — Europe quaked a little bit in its boots, and began negotiating furiously with America to be part of its industrial strategy for this next economy. Who wasn’t part of all this? Britain — because, well, it’s busy reopening coal mines, like some kind of idiot cousin.Let’s do another example — a really chilling one. Paramedics are going on strike, because they’re underpaid, so there aren’t enough of them to do things like respond normally to emergency ambulance calls, which is, you know, their job. The government’s refused to negotiate with them, because, well — LOL — it’s busy blaming immigrants. Britain’s labour shortage is so acute that there’s no way — none — they can be solved without immigration. Those labour shortages exist because Britain basically kicked huge numbers of Europeans out — doctors, nurses, paramedics, and so forth. Now, it doesn’t have enough to supply basic levels of healthcare to the populace. Think about how crazy that is for second — but that’s not even the crazy part yet.The really crazy part is that both sides of British politics are now busy scapegoating immigrants. The Labour Party is blaming immigrants for problems like a broken NHS — when immigrants are the only way it’s ever going to be fixed. If you think I’m kidding, go ahead and imagine American healthcare without all those nice Asian and Indian doctors, and think to yourself how hard it’d be get a doctor’s appointment then. Modern economies need immigration to power higher living standards, even if nobody much wants to champion it. But for a party like Labour — on the center left — to be hating on immigrants in terms more vitriolic than many American Republicans?Something’s very wrong with that. That something isn’t even just that Britain now effectively has two hard right wings, the left now aping the right. It’s that even the center left is now part of the vicious cycle of making Brexit create the very problems it once purported to solve. Think back to Brexit — the idea was that Brexit would fix the NHS. The NHS wasn’t even in a major crisis then — just a minor one, thanks to several years of underinvestment. But now, even Labour’s viciously hating on immigrants as a way to fix the NHS…which is a complete denial of reality. Even Labour’s out there pretending that “trade deals” with, LOL, India, are going to replace double digit losses in trade with Europe — and the consquent shattering, light-speed decline in living standards such a thing entails, as businesses shutter, people get poorer, and there’s less left over for the public purse.Let me put all that now in an American way, which is the easiest way to really understand it. Both sides in British politics are now gaslighting Britain. Instead of offering anything — anything — remotely like a vision, agenda, or plan for the future. Biden is building chip factories and investing so heavily in green energy and manufacturing that Europe’s shaking. Britain…anything? Reopening coal mines. Refusing to pay paramedics more so that people can get ambulances. Blaming immigrants for the woes of the “real” Brit, a problem that Brexit created, by causing economy-shattering labour force shortages. On and on it goes.Both sides in British politics are gaslighting Britain. They’re telling Brits that recent history didn’t happen. That the problems Britain faces now appeared, mysteriously, out of the numinous ether. Not that Brexit created them, because that’s what Big Lies do — create the problems they purport to solve. From shattering the economy to depriving it of labour to cratering living standards and the currency — Brexit created all these problems. And clinging onto its flotsam — xenophobia, the absurdity of trying to strike trade deals with countries vastly poorer, aggression and hostility directed at former friends, blaming nurses and paramedics and teachers and immigrants — none of that is remotely a solution. It’s not a solution in normal times, and it’s definitely not a solution to the greatest self-inflicted calamity in modern history.So. Does Britain have a future? Sure, a Dickensian one. Things are going to get much, much bleaker. You see, when both sides in politics are busy gaslighting people — instead of offering anything remotely like a real agenda, vision, or plan — where can a country go? Britain is getting poorer, fast, in shocking ways, from people unable to afford heat, to shortages of antibiotics, to a lack of ambulances, doctors, and nurses — the list just goes on and on — and these problems require real solutions.Part of those real solutions will involve admitting that Brexit was in fact the most cataclysmic act of self-destruction in the modern history of rich nations. Even America’s pulled ahead of Britain — something unthinkable even a short decade ago. Europe, too, has a future, made of plans, investments, ideas, agendas. Asia does, too, Africa’s arriving, as well. Britain is almost alone in this world — a nation bereft. With no plan for a perilous century. Just Big Lies, it keeps repeating to itself, in ever-widening circles, as if they’re going to fix anything. This is its warning, its lesson — and its tragedy.UmairDecember 2022How Britain’s Destroying ItselfWhat Happens When a Country Decides to Destroy Itself? Just Ask Modern Day Britain"

Sanity’s Winning. So Is Trumpism’s Day in the Sun Coming to an End?Image Credit: Brynn AndersonThere’s a truism — an accepted myth — of American discourse that goes like this: there’s going to be a Next Donald Trump. It comes from pundits, columnists, DC insiders, and so forth, who always ask the question, in a leading form: who will the Next Donald Trump be? Will it be…Ron DeSantis? Glenn Youngkin? A figure who came from nowhere like Kari Lake? The question’s on the lips of America’s establishment, asked breathlessly, repetitively, ubiquitously. Who’s — LOL — the “alarmist” now?But a better question goes like this: what if there is no Next Donald Trump? What if…from here, the remnants of Trumpism fragment and splinter, as they’ve done, like so many other extremist movements, along sectarian lines — and no one leader emerges again who has the magnetic pull that Trump once did? After all, this is what we’ve seen over and over again in history, too, not least with…the Nazis.Let me explain why this is a better way to think about the future of American democracy.Pundits and columnists ask the question this way — “who will the Next Donald Trump be?!” — for a reason. It reveals that they still think of Trump as a thing-in-himself. Not as a symptom, of much deeper maladies, that came to afflict America historically and generationally. And because they think of Trump as a kind of disease with no etiology, no causative factors, hence, there’s surely going to be a Next Donald Trump, too — because, well, there’s little to no real rational thinking here to begin with.But Trump was — emphatically — a symptom. Of many, many ills which came to ravage America, to which the establishment turned, more or less, a blind eye. Let me go through them briefly, because when I do, some might be surprised at how deep the etiology of Trumpism really goes.It was in the 1990s that Robert Putnam, the distinguished sociologist, discovered and charted a stunning collapse in America’s levels of trust. It’s “social capital” — something it was once vaunted for, small-town friendliness and politesse and so forth — was imploding, in shocking ways. He wrote a bestseller about that — Bowling Alone. America’s levels of trust — in institutions of all kinds, particularly government, business, even between neighbors — collapsing systemically. This was decades before Trumpism really emerged — and to scholars and observers of social collapse, alarm bells should have gone off. Because of course neighbors shouldn’t turn on one another.So why was America experiencing this catastrophic collapse in trust? Because the social contract wasn’t working. It was practically nonexistent to speak of. American life was becoming a bitter, brutal, isolated, alienating struggle. A perpetual one. Get up. Go to some underpaid, overworked job — or three. Barely be able to pay the bills. Live on a carousel of debt, and if the music stopped — well, then you were in real trouble. Your health — or your home. Your kids education — or your retirement.You see, America’s economy had begun to stagnate in the 1970s. In 1971, to be precise, which was the precise date that America went from being a net exporter, to being a net importer. Once upon a time, America had made things — things the world made and even treasured, from cars to appliances to heavy machinery and beyond. But by 1971, the American economy had begun to import more than it exported, and consume more than it produced. The result, of course, was skyrocketing levels of debt. Debt which fell on the average person’s shoulders, in the end — because a nation that was now a net importer was of course going to struggle to have robust and strong middle and working classes made of secure, stable, good jobs.By the 2000s or so, that transformation was becoming complete. America’s deindustrialized towns and cities were now its “Rust Belt” — places which once supplied the world with steel, lightbulbs, cars, and so forth. Now they grew sick, afflicted by a panoply of social ills — opioid epidemics, driven by chronic unemployment, which itself drove a collapse in public purses, which meant those places could scarcely afford to provide basic infrastructure and services anymore. Social indicators in many such places began to plummet below the so-called “third world” — and at this point, many Americans began to say that America was becoming a “third world” country.Their peers in Europe and Canada, who enjoyed expansive social contracts made of generous healthcare, high speed transport, affordable education, retirement, for all, looked on, bewildered and shocked. What had happened to America? Many things had happened — but beneath those was an ideology that had come to be known by the 1990s as “the Washington Consensus.” This was the brainchild of a certain group of economists and political scientists, and it was a kind of fatal compromise, between liberalism and conservatism. It took Grover Norquist’s idea of “drowning government in a bathtub,” and married it with “free trade.” The central tenets of the Washington Consensus were that capital should be free, but labour shouldn’t, that jobs could go anywhere, but people couldn’t, that it was perfectly reasonable for markets to allocate public goods — like healthcare and energy and education and transport — that any grad-schooler should have known was the proper role of governments, because, after all, what incentive does a profit-maximizing corporation really have to offer anyone such things? That’s precisely why they’re called public goods.The Washington Consensus was the inflection point. It was to be the End of History — jobs were to flow to the lowest bidder, which meant, in practice, places like China, and what had been lost in America would be “upskilled” by way of…free markets. The theory, like so many theories, was beautiful, in its own fantasy world — immaculate, untouchable. But in practice? All this was disastrous. The private sector didn’t step in to “upskill” millions of Americans whose industrialized jobs had been lost, for good. It didn’t offer them anything. As a result, millions simply dropped out of the labour force entirely.And a feeling of betrayal, rage, and abandonment swept the country. It was concentrated amongst “real” America, “heartland” America, precisely the places where people expected to have better lives than their parents and grandparents, who’d worked those stable, secure, industrial jobs. But now there was nothing. No jobs, no investment, no money, no community, no future. And worse, the Establishment in DC — both sides of it — simply kept on claiming that “the economy was booming!!” And that its plan, the Washington Consensus, was working beautifully. Maybe it was, if you were Larry and Sergey at Google, or Zuck, or Bezos — who’d become basically the middleman between deindustrialized America and industrializing China.But for the average American? Life was becoming a nightmare. A thing of constant, permeating, terrible stress, despair, loneliness, anxiety, fear. Which soon enough was going to boil over into rage, fury, and violence.Because this is how demagogues happen. These are the conditions which set the stage for Trumps — and Hitlers — to rise. In Nazi Germany’s case, it was war reparations which were too steep to repay that drove the average German into penury, and thus straight into the arms of the Nazis. Because the Nazis, of course, told a Big Lie — they pointed the finger at Jews and minorities for the woes of the “pure” and “true” German. And that’s more or less exactly what happened in America.I know that you know parts of that story. We all do. Yet it’s important to really understand it, to feel it, in a visceral sense. Those of who were anti-Trump, and still are, must understand that the sense of betrayal and abandonment felt by the heartland was real. That doesn’t excuse hate and violence, of course — but it does explain it. If your life had fallen apart, too, you might feel just the same way — and doubly so if the establishment simply grinned and told you, hey, you had it pretty good.Trump was a symptom of all these ills. And they’re grave ills. Some of the gravest ills a society can have. A collapse in levels of trust. Economic stagnation for decades — which went into overdrive, and turned into decline. Cities and towns left unable to invest in themselves. People facing lifelong debt traps. Generations facing declining living standards. A heartland that had been reduced to scraping just to get by. These are factors which almost inevitably lead to demagoguery. And so if it hadn’t been Trump, it would’ve simply been someone else.So why was it Trump, who emerged as America’s leading demagogue? Well, there are several very good reasons. One is that he was already a household name, thanks to, LOL, reality TV. Two is that he was helped along — something the establishment is still too reluctant to admit — by Russia, who made it a top security priority of theirs to elevate him to power, and cause “social chaos,” which is why, and this is on the record, they hacked Hillary emails…and the media fell for it. Three is that Trump played the role of demagogue well — he went out there and told people that the establishment had abandoned and betrayed it, which is exactly what they felt. He had as little time for the conservative establishment as for the liberal one. He amped up the bile and created fake enemies everywhere, on every side. And, of course, he was shameless at scapegoating everyone from Jews to the LGBTQ to Mexicans, which is still exactly what he’s doing today.But something’s changed. You see, those historical ills which afflicted America, and made the rise of a demagogic, fanatical, extremist movement like Trumpism all but inevitable? They’re beginning to fade.Now, I don’t want to overstate the case. They’re not magically disappearing at light speed. Nothing like that. But America’s changing. For the better. And the preconditions for Trumpism are disappearing. This is happening in ways prosaic — and historic.Let’s take both in turn.Historic: how do you really undo the preconditions for fascist collapses? You revitalize the working and middle class again. You give it a reason to trust and believe again. In itself, in government, in governance, in a dream, in democratic values — not just hate and blind rage and violence. Bidenomics, remarkably, is doing exactly that. Building chip factories — they’re already coming online. A vision — one of the first in American history — for America to be something again. This time, a net exporter of something the world needs desperately, like clean energy and manufacturing — and remember how becoming a net importer in 1971 laid the roots of American decline?Like I said, this is actually beginning to happen. These are dire, bleak, brutal economic times for everyone. Look at Britain — people can’t afford heat. America’s economy is doing relatively well. That doesn’t mean that it’s Boom Times again — it just means that America’s at the head of the global pack, in an incredibly rough decade. That’s because Bidenomics is actually beginning to work. It’s drawing investment, building factories, slowly but surely, really rebuilding the economy. And all that is beginning to actually revitalize the working and middle class. Those chip factories are going to employ thousands of people directly, and millions indirectly — and that’s just the beginning.Like I said: historic. And America’s changing as a result.Have you noticed what I have? It might seem prosaic — yet I think it’s anything but. Americans are becoming gentler people. Yes, I know, I know. But hear me out. You see, a decade or so ago, they were numb, burned out, eyes glazed over. And today? They talk to each other. They’ve become friendlier. They’re becoming warmer, maybe a bit wiser. They rejected extremism vehemently in the midterms — and if you go to a cafe, people will actually say hi.That might sound like a small thing, but to me? It’s not, at all. Remember Putnam’s Bowling Alone? The collapse of social capital and trust is perhaps the ultimate leading indicator of social implosion. But on the flipside, trust coming back to life is the strongest indicator of social renewal, too. And Americans are changing. You can see it in social attitudes which reject the fanatical Supreme Court as illegitimate. But you can also see just that in the way that Americans are, well, more accepting of each other, friendlier. It’s a Big Deal. It says that society is coming back to life.And all of that is good reason to doubt that there’ll be a Next Donald Trump. You see, from the top down, the American economy is being rebuilt, with a plan, a vision, a really good one. No more being a net importer — now we export what the world needs, and we prosper, as a nation, as a result. And from the bottom up, Americans have rejected extremism, and are changing, becoming more accepting. These two things are related. This is how societies come back to life — not just top down or bottom up, but both, hand in hand.Trumpism? It’s likelier to follow the path so many extremist movements have. Think of what happens to them after their Führer is gone. They splinter and split and fragment. This mini-demagogue is able to capture this wing, and that mini-demagogue, that one. But it’s rare to find the emergence of another Mega-Demagogue who can unite the whole movement. This is a pattern of history, too. It’s what we’ve seen in Middle Eastern extremism — once the charismatic head is gone, fanatical groups struggle to really endure, let alone grow. It’s what happened to the Nazis, of course. It happened to revolutionary communism, too, in the 1950s and then the 1970s. The only places where we really haven’t seen it are those like North Korea — where authoritarian dynasties persist because they’ve managed to wall off their entire populations from the world.Will there be a Next Donald Trump? If you ask me, it’s looking more dubious by the day. And that’s a remarkable achievement. You see, until January 6th or so, you might well have expected there to be. But now? Look at America. Americans have made it pretty clear they don’t want another fanatic, extremist, bigot, ignoramus. They want peace, democracy, and better lives. Or rather. At least enough of them to have sent a resounding message to the fanatics and lunatics. When societies make that choice — when people make that choice — the days of demagogues are numbered.The contender to the Trumpist throne? They’re more likely to fragment what once used to be a unified extremist movement. One controlling this end of it, that one, another end of it. But the mainstream has figured out something that the fanatics are still desperate to tell them Big Lies about:Demagoguery didn’t work. It didn’t solve anything, accomplish anything, lead anywhere. And once a society figures that out, my friends — well, usually, there is no Next Demagogue, Führer, or Dear Leader. There’s just a slow, if sometimes unsteady, return to democracy — and sometimes, even, the small miracle of growth, moral, social, emotional, as people learn from their mistakes. If you ask me? That’s where America is right about now.UmairDecember 2022Will There Really Be a Next Donald Trump?America’s Changing. Sanity’s Winning.

Think of what happens to them after their Führer is gone. They splinter and split and fragment. This mini-demagogue is able to capture this wing, and that mini-demagogue, that one. But it’s rare to find the emergence of another Mega-Demagogue who can unite the whole movement. This is a pattern of history, too. It’s what we’ve seen in Middle Eastern extremism — once the charismatic head is gone, fanatical groups struggle to really endure, let alone grow. It’s what happened to the Nazis, of course. It happened to revolutionary communism, too, in the 1950s and then the 1970s. The only places where we really haven’t seen it are those like North Korea — where authoritarian dynasties persist because they’ve managed to wall off their entire populations from the world.Will there be a Next Donald Trump? If you ask me, it’s looking more dubious by the day. And that’s a remarkable achievement. You see, until January 6th or so, you might well have expected there to be. But now? Look at America. Americans have made it pretty clear they don’t want another fanatic, extremist, bigot, ignoramus. They want peace, democracy, and better lives. Or rather. At least enough of them to have sent a resounding message to the fanatics and lunatics. When societies make that choice — when people make that choice — the days of demagogues are numbered.The contender to the Trumpist throne? They’re more likely to fragment what once used to be a unified extremist movement. One controlling this end of it, that one, another end of it. But the mainstream has figured out something that the fanatics are still desperate to tell them Big Lies about:Demagoguery didn’t work. It didn’t solve anything, accomplish anything, lead anywhere. And once a society figures that out, my friends — well, usually, there is no Next Demagogue, Führer, or Dear Leader. There’s just a slow, if sometimes unsteady, return to democracy — and sometimes, even, the small miracle of growth, moral, social, emotional, as people learn from their mistakes. If you ask me? That’s where America is right about now.UmairDecember 2022Will There Really Be a Next Donald Trump?America’s Changing. Sanity’s Winning. So Is Trumpism’s Day in the Sun Coming to an End?"
